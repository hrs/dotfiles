     Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
     interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with
     SAS, S-PLUS, R, BUGS/JAGS and other statistical analysis packages
     on Unix, Linux and Microsoft Windows.  ESS is itself a package
     within the emacs text editor and uses emacs features to streamline
     the creation and use of statistical software.  ESS knows the
     syntax and grammar of statistical analysis packages and provides
     consistent display and editing features based on that knowledge.
     ESS assists in interactive and batch execution of statements
     written in these statistical analysis languages.

1 Introduction to ESS
*********************

The S family (S, Splus and R) and SAS statistical analysis packages
provide sophisticated statistical and graphical routines for
manipulating data.   Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) is based on the
merger of two pre-cursors, S-mode and SAS-mode, which provided support
for the S family and SAS respectively.  Later on, Stata-mode was also
incorporated.

   ESS provides a common, generic, and useful interface, through emacs,
to many statistical packages.  It currently supports the S family, SAS,
BUGS/JAGS, Stata and XLisp-Stat with the level of support roughly in
that order.

   A bit of notation before we begin.  _emacs_ refers to both _GNU
Emacs_ by the Free Software Foundation, as well as _XEmacs_ by the
XEmacs Project.  The emacs major mode `ESS[language]', where `language'
can take values such as `S', `SAS', or `XLS'.  The inferior process
interface (the connection between emacs and the running process)
referred to as inferior ESS (`iESS'), is denoted in the modeline by
`ESS[dialect]', where `dialect' can take values such as `S3', `S4',
`S+3', `S+4', `S+5', `S+6', `S+7', `R', `XLS', `VST', `SAS'.

   Currently, the documentation contains many references to ``S'' where
actually any supported (statistics) language is meant, i.e., `S' could
also mean `XLisp-Stat' or `SAS'.

   For exclusively interactive users of S, ESS provides a number of
features to make life easier.  There is an easy to use command history
mechanism, including a quick prefix-search history.  To reduce typing,
command-line completion is provided for all S objects and "hot keys"
are provided for common S function calls.  Help files are easily
accessible, and a paging mechanism is provided to view them.  Finally,
an incidental (but very useful) side-effect of ESS is that a transcript
of your session is kept for later saving or editing.

   No special knowledge of Emacs is necessary when using S
interactively under ESS.

   For those that use S in the typical edit-test-revise cycle when
programming S functions, ESS provides for editing of S functions in
Emacs edit buffers.  Unlike the typical use of S where the editor is
restarted every time an object is edited, ESS uses the current Emacs
session for editing.  In practical terms, this means that you can edit
more than one function at once, and that the ESS process is still
available for use while editing.  Error checking is performed on
functions loaded back into S, and a mechanism to jump directly to the
error is provided.  ESS also provides for maintaining text versions of
your S functions in specified source directories.

1.1 Why should I use ESS?
=========================

Statistical packages are powerful software systems for manipulating and
analyzing data, but their user interfaces often leave something
something to be desired:  they offer weak editor functionality and they
differ among themselves so markedly that you have to re-learn how to do
those things for each package.  ESS is a package which is designed to
make editing and interacting with statistical packages more uniform,
user-friendly and give you the power of emacs as well.

   ESS provides several features which make it easier to interact with
the ESS process (a connection between your buffer and the statistical
package which is waiting for you to input commands).  These include:

   * Command-line editing for fixing mistakes in commands before they
     are entered.  The `-e' flag for S-plus provides something similar
     to this, but here you have the full range of Emacs commands rather
     than a limited subset.  However, other packages such as XLisp-Stat
     and S3 do not necessarily have features like this built-in.  *Note
     Command-line editing::.

   * Searchable command history for recalling previously-submitted
     commands.  This provides all the features of the `Splus -e' history
     mechanism, plus added features such as history searching.  *Note
     Command History::.

   * Command-line completion of both object and file names for quick
     entry.  This is similar to `tcsh''s facility for filenames; here it
     also applies to object names and list components.  *Note
     Completion::.

   * Hot-keys for quick entry of commonly-used commands in `S' such as
     `objects()' and `search()'.  *Note Hot keys::.

   * Transcript recording for a complete record of all the actions in an
     S session.  *Note Transcript::.

   * Interface to the help system, with a specialized mode for viewing S
     help files.  *Note Help::.


   If you commonly create or modify S functions, you will have found
the standard facilities for this (the `fix()' function, for example)
severely limiting.  Using S's standard features, one can only edit one
function at a time, and you can't continue to use S while editing.  ESS
corrects these problems by introducing the following features:

   * Object editing.  ESS allows you to edit more than one function
     simultaneously in dedicated Emacs buffers.  The ESS process may
     continue to be used while functions are being edited.  *Note Edit
     buffer::.

   * A specialized editing mode for S code, which provides syntactic
     indentation and highlighting.  *Note Indenting::.

   * Facilities for loading and error-checking source files, including a
     keystroke to jump straight to the position of an error in a source
     file.  *Note Error Checking::.

   * Source code revision maintenance, which allows you to keep historic
     versions of S source files.  *Note Source Files::.

   * Facilities for evaluating S code such as portions of source files,
     or line-by-line evaluation of files (useful for debugging).  *Note
     Evaluating code::.

   Finally, ESS provides features for re-submitting commands from saved
transcript files, including:

   * Evaluation of previously entered commands, stripping away
     unnecessary prompts.  *Note Transcript resubmit::.

1.2 New features in ESS
=======================

     Changes/New Features in 5.14:
        * ESS[BUGS/JAGS]:  Batch BUGS is back!  For recent OpenBUGS
          versions, 3.0.8+, a batch BUGS script is once again available,
          but for Linux only.  Therefore, since it seems that BUGS and
          JAGS must co-exist (rather than a transition from BUGS to
          JAGS), .bug files are now in ESS[BUGS] mode and .jag files
          are in ESS[JAGS] mode.  ESS[BUGS] now works like ESS[JAGS]
          rather than the original mode ESS[BUGS] mode which was
          difficult to maintain.  Although, ESS[BUGS] appears to work,
          there still may be some features missing as well as bugs.

        * ESS[R]: New customizable variable `ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p'
          Commands to Sweave current file and LaTeX the result are now
          available to AUCTeX users, if this variable is set to `t'.

        * ESS[S]: `C-c C-c' (`ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step')
          is now skipping over comments as the other paragraph
          functions do.  It (and similar functions) should no longer
          wrongly find `function()' beginnings inside comments or
          strings.

        * ESS[SAS]: improved by better support for GNU Emacs

     Changes/New Features in 5.13:
        * ESS[R]: On Windows, for R 2.12.0 and later, the Rterm
          executables  (in subdirectories i386 / x64) now are found as
          well as for earlier R versions.

        * ESS[S+]: on Windows, both 32- and 64-bit versions of S+
          ("S-PLUS")  are found now and made available on the menu.

        * ESS[R]: When prompting for a starting directory, the R
          version is  (always?) correct now.

        * ESS[R]: on non-Windows platforms, the `use-dialog-box'
          variable is no longer temporarily changed (to `nil' for
          R-x.y.z version  functions and to `t' for `R' itself), but
          rather the user  customization is obeyed.

        * ESS[R]: more Roxygen improvements.

        * `Rd-preview-help' now generates preview buffers with
          navigation facilities the same as regular help buffers.

        * ESS: New functions and keys C-c [up] / [down]  for evaluating
          the buffer "from beginning till here".

     Changes/New Features in 5.12:
        * ESS[SAS] Font-locking:  update of PROCs keywords (up to SAS
          9.22); error/warnings.

        * ESS[R]: Roxygen improvements: S4 classes;  also optionally
          keep spaces when filling arguments

        * ESS[Rd]: support new keywords:  section-name \subsection plus
          a dozen "new" keywords; should match R  2.12.x now.

        * `ess-display-help-on-object' (`C-c C-v')  now _caches_ the
          list of topics, thus speeding up the improvement  feature
          introduced in 5.9.

     Changes/New Features in 5.11:
        * Filename completion within buffers now adds only trailing
          characters to complete the filename, rather than expanding to
          an absolute file path.  This filename completion is bound to
          the TAB key.

        * `M-n P' in Sweave buffers now prompts for the command to run
          instead of using `pdflatex' unconditionally, offering
          completion from customizable collection
          `ess-swv-pdflatex-commands', the first of which is taken as
          default and that defaults to `texi2pdf'.

        * `M-RET' is now also bound in S language (R and S+) buffers to
          `ess-use-this-dir'. It sends `setwd(..)' to the S process to
          set the working directory to the one of the source file.

     Changes/New Features in 5.10:
        * `M-RET' in *S* buffers is now bound to `ess-dirs'.  This
          function will set Emacs's current directory to be the same as
          the *S* process.  This is useful if you use `setwd()' within
          a *S* process.

     Changes/New Features in 5.9:
        * Toolbar:  The toolbar now has an icon for starting Splus.

        * Indentation: New documentation and code has been added to
          make it easier to change how ESS indents code.  In
          particular, see `ess-default-style', `ess-own-style-list' and
          the documention subsection "Changing indentation styles".

        * `ess-display-help-on-object' (`C-c C-v') now offers
          completion candidates for help file aliases, in addition to
          object  names.

        * Font locking: is now turned on  even without `window-system'
          is `nil', whenever  ESS-FONT-LOCK-MODE is non-nil, i.e., by
          default.

        * ESS script editing: ess-eval-deactivate-mark default is now t,
          as suggested by Leo Alekseyev and subsequent "unanimous"
          ESS-help  discussion.

        * ESS[R]: Editing support for "#!" (Rscript / littler) editing,
          thanks to Jeffrey Arnold.

        * ESS[R]: Now finds all R versions, both 64-bit and 32-bit, on
          some  64-bit Windows machines.  Please report back to
          ess-core success or failure  on your 64-bit Windows machine.

        * ESS Manual now more visually pleasing;
          `http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html'

        * ESS[R]: Roxygen on XEmacs no longer font locks for now  (as
          it required missing features and hence broke ESS startup,
          there).

        * ESS[R]: Roxygen has a sub-menu on the [ESS] menu.

        * ESS[R]: Function `ess-rutils-htmldocs' in  `ess-rutils.el'
          offers an alternative to `help.start()' for  navigating R
          documentation, using the `browse-url' Emacs  function.

     Changes/New Features in 5.8:
        * ESS[R]: New `ess-rutils.el' with utilities for listing,
          loading, installing, and updating packages, as well as object
          manipulation (listing, viewing, and deleting).  It also
          provides an alternative to `RSiteSearch()' that uses the
          `browse-url' function, so results can be viewed in an Emacs
          web browser.

        * ESS[R]: much more extensive Roxygen interface, via ess-roxy.el
          from Henning Redestig. Ess-roxy supports filling of roxygen
          fields,  generation and updating roxygen templates,
          completion of roxygen tags,  basic navigation (marking and
          moving between entries), folding using  hs-minor-mode and
          preview of the Rd file.

        * Emacs lisp files have got better names (partly, for now).

     Changes/New Features in 5.7:
        * ESS[R]: loading a source file (`C-c C-l') now works in
          Windows, similarly to other platforms;  (further; it had
          accidentally been broken in ESS 5.6 on all platforms)

     Changes/New Features in 5.6:
        * ESS[R]: help() calls have to differ from old default, with
          newer  versions of R; currently via .help.ESS <-
          function(...) hack.

     Changes/New Features in 5.4:
        * ESS[SAS]: The long overdue change from `make-regexp' to
          `regexp-opt' for font-locking is complete.  The new
          `regexp-opt' is now the default since it is better than the
          old code in many ways (and especially more maintainable).
          However, there are certainly some special cases missed (bug
          reports and patches welcome!).  Setting
          `ess-sas-run-regexp-opt' to `nil' will result in the old code
          being used.

        * ESS[BUGS] and ESS[JAGS]: typing `=' now results in  `<-'.

        * ESS[R] function arguments "show" `(ess-r-args-show)' now
          uses the new `(tooltip-show-at-point)' contributed by Erik
          Iverson.

        * Toolbar icons now also work in (beta) Emacs 23.

        * ESS[S]: New function `ess-change-directory' for setting both
          emacs' current directory and the directory of an *R* or *S*
          buffer.

        * ESS[S] when transient-mark-mode is true, the mark is now kept,
          rather than deactivated, thanks to a patch from David Reitter.

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.11:
        * ESS[SAS]: work around bug in Emacs 22.2 & 22.3 which fails to
          set case-fold fontification automatically.

        * Rd mode: support new keyword 'Rdversion'

        * ESS[R]: now again works with Emacs 21.x

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.10:
        * Fixed noweb-mode bug accidentally introduced into 5.3.9

        * In noweb-mode, e.g., Rnw-mode, electric "<" also inserts
          closing "@".   Further, the code chunk boundaries are better
          kept up-to-date, such that  code[R] <-> text[LaTeX] minor
          mode switching should happen more reliably.

        * In noweb-mode, fix a buglet in rare [Enter] or [Tab]
          behavior; further,  by default disable the former `[[' ..
          `]]'  code-protection-when-filling  behavior which has been
          found to be buggy.

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.9:
        * ESS[SAS]: evince PDF viewer now supported as well; search
          order: evince, Xpdf, Adobe/Acrobat Reader

        * ESS[R]: added support for Roxygen, potentially to be extended.

        * ESS[S] (and R): inferior (`*R*') and transcript modes no
          longer fontify language keywords (such as `for', `in', etc).

        * iESS[Stata]: Customize the `ess-sta-delimiter-friendly'
          setting to `t' to convert embedded semi-colons to newlines
          for Stata processing.

        * Sweave fix for embedded blanks in PDF reader and PDF files

        * Several fixes for Major Mode Convention violations in
          `ess-mode' and `noweb-mode'.

        * ESS[JAGS]: `M-x comment-region' now available!

        * ESS[S] The `ess-swv-*' commands (and keybindings) are now in
          a submenu of the "Noweb" menu, when editing Sweave files.

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.8:
        * ESS[JAGS]: more separation from ESS[BUGS] (as much as is
          currently planned); now `C-c C-c' on an empty `.jmd' creates
          a template as it should; symbolic links are created for CODA
          output so BOA is happy: from `index.txt' to `.ind' and
          `chain#.txt' to `#.out'

        * ESS[SAS]: buffer-local `ess-sas-submit-command' and
          `ess-sas-submit-command-options' now recognized by
          `ess-sas-submit-region'

        * ESS[S]: When trying to evaluate code in an S language buffer
          and  there is no associated process, now start R
          automatically instead of  signalling an error.  Also, restart
          R if there is an associated process  which is not running.
          However, do not start R just via the "electric"  `('
          (`ess-r-args-auto-show').

        * ESS[S]: For (one-line) functions withOUT '{ .. }' bodys, the
          end  of function is now correctly found more often.  This
          notably improves  `C-c C-c'
          (`ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step').

        * ESS[JAGS]: cleanup/re-organization of elisp code; symbolic
          links for CODA output are now only created by the new JAGS
          `system' command in version 1.0.3; specify whether this
          command is available via `ess-jags-system'; if not present,
          then no links are created so that the `*shell*' buffer does
          not become unresponsive during the batch run

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.7:
        * ESS: `ess-default-style' now *is* customizable, i.e.,
          changing its value in `~/.emacs' now does have the desired
          effect.

        * ESS: `ess-font-lock-mode' is a new variable (default: t)
          which controls whether font-locking is enabled in ESS buffers.

        * ESS[R]: for XEmacs on Windows; another tweak to find R
          versions

        * ESS[SAS]: font-locking updated for ODS and SAS Bayesian
          Procedures; a more consistent handling of SAS options by
          `ess-sas-submit-command-options' which is buffer-local;
          portable snooze for MS Windows via customize-able
          `ess-sleep-for' (floats welcome); Xpdf now supported as a PDF
          viewer

        * ESS[Rnw]: now also works with "emacs -nw" and Emacs 22.

        * ESS[JAGS]: now requires JAGS 1.0 (see the new ESS for JAGS
          help section for more information): both need work;
          suggestions welcome

        * ESS[R]: [TAB] completion now uses the R-internal completion
          mechanism (for R >= 2.5.0).

        * ESS[R] ([S]): interpretation of "_" as assignment has been
          removed in `ess-continued-statement-p' for R and S.

        * several internal code cleanups.

        * ESS[R]: An experimental version of a new command `Rgui' on MS
          Windows to send lines directly from emacs to `Rgui' is
          available in file `lisp/essd-rgui.el'.  Preliminary
          documentation is in file `doc/rgui-doc.txt'.

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.6:
        * ESS: for XEmacs, using "gnuclient" (without a "-q") works for
          things like fix() after M-x gnuserv-start has been done.

        * ESS[R]: M-x R-newest should now work in more situations on MS
          Windows, e.g., when R has been installed in a non-default
          "ProgramFiles"  directory tree.  In these cases, there's no
          need to specify the name (and  full path) of the R program
          anymore.

        * ESS[R]: For XEmacs, startup (with new tooltip code) works
          again.

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.5:
        * ESS[R] a new defun is available, `M-x R-newest', which will
          start the newest version of R that it can find on your system.

        * ESS[R] add Sven Hartenstein's "R function arguments tips"
          functionality, via new file `../lisp/essd-r-args.el'.   Note
          that this includes an "electric "("" behavior inside `R-mode'
          which is _active by default_ and can be customized via
          `ess-r-args-electric-paren'; i.e., use `(setq
          ess-r-args-electric-paren nil)' to turn it off.  Further,
          `ess-r-args-show-as' allows to switch to the "tooltip" mode.

        * ESS: functions `ess-get-pdf-viewer' and *-ps-viewer; built on
          new  customizable variables `ess-pdf-viewer-pref' and
          `ess-ps-viewer-pref'; currently used in `ess-swv-PDF' and
          `*-PS'.

        * ESS[R] Improved `ess-swv-PDF' to run pdf viewer only if
          pdflatex was ok

        * ESS[R] Improved `ess-swv-weave' to start R automatically if
          none is running.

        * ESS: Do no longer ask _which_ ESS process to use if there  is
          only one.

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.4:
        * ESS[R] now better work with options(error=recover); and the
          new default of CHM help files on windows.

        * ESS[R] some more cleanup in the "sweave" functions

        * miscellaneous fixes

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.3:
        * ESS[S] fix buglet (5.3.2 only) which left command prompt in
          "execute buffer" and hence help files.

        * new customizable variable `ess-display-buffer-reuse-frames'
          set to true (which changes default behavior) such that
          execution or help *frames* are reused.

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.2:
        * Classic BUGS now supported by `(require 'essd-bugs)' with
          ESS[BUGS]       and JAGS by `(require 'essd-jags)' with
          ESS[JAGS].  But, only one       of them can be used at a time
          since they don't play nice together.  Also,       `C-c C-c'
          is now bound to the function `ess-bugs-next-action'
          (`F12' has been retired).  And finally, note that
          `essl-bug.el'       is deprecated and the replacement is
          `essl-bugs.el'.

        * ESS[R] Improved some of the "Sweave-make"  functions (yet
          scarcely documented) in `ess-swv.el'.

        * ESS[S] No longer mess with .Last.value (nor in other
          "languages").

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.1:
        * See the docs for 2 ways to install ESS for XEmacs
            1. by uncommenting the XEmacs part of             Section 1
               of `Makeconf' and performing `make install'

            2. by unpacking either             `ess-5.3.1.tgz' or
               `ess-5.3.1.zip' into
               `PREFIX/lib/xemacs/site-packages' on unix or
               `PREFIX\XEmacs\site-packages' on windows

        * ESS[R]: fixed bugs so that Rterm.exe can be found by XEmacs

        * ESS[S]: `ess-toggle-S-assign-key' is slightly changed; in
          particular, the default `ess-assign-key' is now `C-x ='.

        * ESS[R]: `M-x R-site-search' is a new (slightly experimental)
          utility similar to R's `RSiteSearch(..)' but with the
          advantage of  using Emacs' preferred browser, see
          `browse-url-browser-function'

     Changes/New Features in 5.3.0:
        * ESS[BUGS]: sanely re-format statistical output, `.bog', from
          scientific notation to numbers rounded with 4 decimal places
          with `M-x ess-bugs-sci-round-to-4-dp'.

        * The keys for navigating among section headings in help buffers
          worked, but only for one language per session; they should
          now work for multiple languages.  (They were also broken on
          Windows machines.)

        * ESS[S] long standing buglets in the internal logic for loading
          lisp code on Windows.  Particularly fixed behavior in help
          mode with S-plus GUI.

        * New variable, `ess-use-inferior-program-name-in-buffer-name',
          which enables using the executable name instead of the
          dialect name for R. Feature request.

        * ESS[S] `ess-execute-screen-options' now also works correctly
          when there is more than one window *side-by-side* in the same
          frame and runs in the correct buffer also when there is more
          than one S buffer.

        * iESS[S] new functions `ess-eval-paragraph-and-step' and
          `ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step' are bound to keys
          `C-c C-p' and `C-c C-c' respectively and to the menu in
          ESS-mode; also bound in the help mode (for evaluating
          examples).

        * ESS[S] new function `ess-toggle-S-assign-key' allows to
          assign the " <- " insertion to an arbitrary key.


     Changes/New Features in 5.2.12:
        * ESS[SAS]: `M-;' fixed, but the XEmacs function `comment-dwim'
          may be broken, if so, use `M-x comment-region' and `M-x
          uncomment-region' instead; only valid PROCs are fontified
          which is very helpful finding syntax errors (currently
          supported: BASE, ETS, FSP, GRAPH, IML, INSIGHT and STAT); the
          "feature" where `F'-keys take you to an empty buffer when the
          requested destination is a file that does not exist has been
          fixed, now the request results in a no-op.  Further, sas-mode
          now also works in simple terminals.

        * Rterm/Cygwin combination works under Microsoft Windows.

        * ESS[R]: internal calls use baseenv() instead of NULL and
          define 'baseenv' where needed.

        * New experimental support for installing ESS.  See the file
          `lisp/ess-install.el'.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.11:
        * ESS Info entry and `dir' handled more effectively for GNU
          Emacs users

        * ESS[SAS]: temporary files created for batch submission of a
          region are now named based on the current file; see
          `ess-sas-file-root' for details; all `lag' and `dif'
          functions now fontified correctly

        * iESS[SAS]: fixed a few nagging bugs, however, still does not
          appear to work at this time; please let us know if you have
          any ideas.

        * ESS[S]: Support for running other versions of Splus has been
          added for unix.  Two new variables, `ess-s-versions' and
          `ess-s-versions-list', are used to tell ESS what other
          versions of Splus you would like to run.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.10:
        * ESS[R]: ess-r-versions can no longer be customized (since the
          customization was not taking effect unless customizations
          were loaded before ESS).  Its value has been changed so that
          it will also find R executables beginning "R-devel" and
          "R-patched".  If you wish to change this variable, it must be
          set in your `.emacs' before ESS is loaded.

        * Installation with GNU Make enhanced:  unix and unix-like
          operating systems will now be able to install ESS for all
          users in either a GNU Emacs site-lisp or an XEmacs package
          configuration by editing `lisp/ess-site.el' and `Makeconf'
          accordingly, then issuing `make install'

        * ESS[S]: Filename completion (inside strings) now also works in
          XEmacs for R and S-plus.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.9:
        * ESS[R] for Windows:  the \ directory character bug with
          respect to ess-load-file has been eradicated.

        * iESS[SAS]: `C-c C-r' and `C-c C-b' once again work as
          intended and documented.

        * ESS[S]: M-x ess-fix-EQ-assign is a bit more agressive.

        * ESS[S]: Imenu now also shows setAs(), etc.

        * ESS[R]: R function pattern enhanced with underlying code such
          that  `M-C-a' (`ess-beginning-of-function') etc now work for
          many more  cases, including S4 method definitions.

        * iESS[R]: myOwnhelp(1) no longer wrongly triggers help(1).

        * ESS[R]: Improved detection of bogus help buffers: valid help
          buffers containing with the string "no documentation"(e.g.
          contour)  were being treated as bogus.

        * ESS[R]: In R help buffers, if
          `options("help.try.all.packages" =  TRUE)' then `?rlm' will
          list which packages rlm is defined in.  This help  buffer is
          not bogus, but instead is now relabelled "*help[R](rlm in
          packages)*".

        * ESS[STA]: add "//" as comment starting character to
          syntax-table.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.8:
        * iESS: [Tab] completes *file* names "inside string" as in
          earlier (<= 5.2.3) ESS versions.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.7:
        * If you use Custom to change the variable ess-toolbar-items,
          the new toolbar is used in all subsequent ESS buffers.

        * ESS[SAS]: new feature:  if ess-sas-log-max >0 and your .log
          grows to more than ess-sas-log-max bytes, just the first
          ess-sas-log-max bytes are refreshed; this is helpful when
          your .sas program generates lots of error messages and gets
          too big for emacs to display

        * ESS[R/S]: `M-;' in R/S editing modes will now indent with
          either one or two hashes depending on context.

        * ESS[R]: David Whiting's Sweave extensions (to 'noweb') are
          now available (from ess-swv.el loaded by default).

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.6:
        * Removed non-ASCII characters in a few files.

        * ESS[R]: now works better when UTF-8 locale is active; in
          particular, you get correct directional quotes in R's startup
          message  for R-devel (unstable development version of R
          2.1.0) when using  environment variables LANGUAGE=en@quot
          LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

        * ESS[SAS]: toggling of .log mode improved (`F10'); toggling of
          .lst mode now also available (`C-F10'); killing all buffers
          associated with .sas program no longer bound to `C-F10' since
          its a bit overzealous.

        * S-Plus 7 for Windows is now recognized.

        * ESS[S] (incl. R): in auto-fill mode, strings are not wrapped
          anymore.

        * ESS[S] (incl. R): font-lock now correctly differs between R
          and S, e.g., for "_"; both now fontify warning(.) and S does
          terminate() additionally.

        * Support for `bell' aka `beep' aka `ding' aka `alarm' in all
          inferior modes: When \a is output "to the the console" at the
          beginning of a line, the bell is rung.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.5:
        * ESS[R]: `C-c C-q' or `Quit S' from the menu now should work
          (again and less klunkily) and do not append `-exited' to the
          buffer name.  Further, the behavior of `(ess-cleanup)',
          called from ess-quit, now depends on the new customizable
          variable `ess-S-quit-kill-buffers-p' which defaults to `nil'.
          Consequently, the question _"Delete all buffers associated
          with ..?"_ will not be asked anymore by default.

        * ESS[SAS] - ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace will now
          work with the `recode' application as well which is available
          on many platforms

        * ESS[S] (incl. R): Name completion for slots of S4 objects now
          works!

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.4:
        * The documentation now includes an overview of how to use the
          emacs TAGS facility for S functions.  (The distribution also
          used to contain a directory `etc/other/Tags' where a ~1990
          version of `etags.c' was distributed; this is no longer
          relevant and so has been deleted.)

        * ESS[SAS] - When you are working with EBCDIC files on an ASCII
          platform, .log NOTEs may display as gibberish since the EBCDIC
          characters are not converted to ASCII prior to their display.
          So, the function ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace is
          provided for convenience and is bound to `C-F11'.  This
          function requires the `dd' command (only available on unix or
          unix-like platforms).

        * ESS: Completion of object names is now always done
          dynamically rather than allowing the option of using a
          pre-computed database (by `ess-create-object-name-db') since
          modern computers seem fast enough for dynamic completion.
          (We expect few users, if any, have been using the
          pre-computed database method.)

        * ESS: object completion in iESS buffers running on Windows was
          very slow (for GNU Emacs, but not XEmacs) and has now been
          fixed.  Further, it was more or less broken for all versions
          of S-plus 6.x, and has been fixed to work everywhere but with
          the Windows' GUI of S-plus.  The list of objects now shows
          unique names also when an object appears more than once in
          the search path.

        * ESS[R]: Completion of object names now also includes those
          starting with ".".

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.3:
        * ESS: When new inferior ESS processes are created, by default
          they will replace the current buffer (this restores behavior
          from pre 5.2.0). If you wish new ESS processes to start in
          another window of the current frame, set
          inferior-ess-same-window to nil.

        * New variables inferior-Splus-args and inferior-R-args provide
          a way to pass command line arguments to starting S and R
          processes.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.2:
        * bug-fixes for 5.2.1 (require 'executable), html docs, etc.

        * ess-lisp-directory/../doc/info added to Info-directory-list
          if ess-info not found by info

        * ESS[R]: If you have other versions of R on your exec-path,
          such as "R-1.8.1" with Unix or "rw1081" with Windows, ESS
          will find them and create appropriate functions, such as `M-x
          R-1.8.1' or `M-x rw1081', for calling them.  By default only
          Unix programs beginning "R-1" and "R-2" and Windows programs
          parallel to the version of R in your exec-path will be found,
          but see ess-r-versions and ess-rterm-versions for ways to
          find other versions of R.

        * ESS[R]: Other versions of R, such as "R-1.8.1" on Unix and
          "rw1081" on Windows, are added to the "ESS / Start Process /
          Other" menu.

        * ESS[S]: If you have other versions of S-Plus on your Windows
          computer, such as S-Plus 6.1 or S-Plus 4.5, ESS will find
          them and create appropriate functions, such as `M-x splus61',
          for calling the console version (Sqpe) inside an emacs
          buffer.  By default only programs installed in the default
          location will be found, but see ess-SHOME-versions for ways
          to find other versions of S-Plus.

        * ESS[S]: Other versions of Sqpe on Windows, such as "splus61",
          are added to the "ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.

        * ESS[R]: (bug fix) ess-quit (bound to `C-c C-q') should now
          quit the inferior R process, when issued from either the
          inferior buffer, or from a .R buffer.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.1:
        * ESS[S] (R and S-plus): now have toolbar support with icons to
          evaluate code in the inferior process or to switch there.
          This code is experimental and likely to change as XEmacs/Emacs
          issues get resolved. The toolbar should be enabled if your
          Emacs displays images, but can be disabled with the variable
          ess-use-toolbar.  Thanks to David Smith from Insightful for
          the S-plus logo.

        * ESS[SAS]: ess-sas-graph-view (`F12') enhanced; you can specify
          external file viewers for each graphics file type via the
          alist ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist; also .jpg/.gif are now
          handled by image-mode on XEmacs, if available, otherwise by
          graphics primitives as before

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:
        * ESS[BUGS]:  new info documentation!  now supports interactive
          processing thanks to Aki Vehtari (mailto:Aki.Vehtari@hut.fi);
          new architecture-independent unix support as well as support
          for BUGS v. 0.5

        * ESS[SAS]:  convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript; info
          documentation improved; Local Variable bug fixes; SAS/IML
          statements/functions now highlighted; files edited remotely
          by ange-ftp/EFS/tramp are recognized and pressing SUBMIT
          opens a buffer on the remote host via the local variable
          ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init which defaults to "ssh";
          changed the definition of the variable
          ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle to boolean rather than 0/1; added
          the function ess-electric-run-semicolon which automatically
          reverse indents lines containing only "run;"; `C-F1' creates
          MS RTF portrait from the current buffer; `C-F2' creates MS
          RTF landscape from the current buffer; `C-F9' opens a SAS
          DATASET with PROC INSIGHT rather than PROC FSVIEW; "inferior"
          aliases for SAS batch:  `C-c C-r' for submit region, `C-c
          C-b' for submit buffer, `C-c C-x' for goto .log; `C-c C-y'
          for goto .lst

        * ESS[S]: Pressing underscore ("_") once inserts " <- " (as
          before); pressing underscore twice inserts a literal
          underscore.  To stop this smart behaviour, add
          "(ess-toggle-underscore nil)" to your .emacs after ess-site
          has been loaded; ess-dump-filename-template-proto (new name!)
          now can be customized successfully (for S language dialects);
          Support for Imenu has been improved; set ess-imenu-use-S to
          non-nil to get an "Imenu-S" item on your menubar; ess-help:
          Now using nice underlines (instead of `nuke-* ^H_')

        * ESS[R]:  After (require 'essa-r), `M-x ess-r-var' allows to
          load numbers from any Emacs buffer into an existing *R*
          process; `M-x ess-rdired' gives a "directory editor" of R
          objects; fixed ess-retr-lastvalue-command, i.e. .Last.value
          bug (thanks to David Brahm)

        * ESS: Support for creating new window frames has been added to
          ESS.  Inferior ESS processes can be created in dedicated
          frames by setting inferior-ess-own-frame to t.  ESS help
          buffers can also open in new frames; see the documentation
          for ess-help-own-frame for details.  (Thanks to Kevin Rodgers
          for contributing code.)

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.24:
        * The version number is now correct even inside ESS/Emacs

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.23:
        * Minor more Makefile clean up.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
        * Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML documentation are
          also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
          on the web as well; see ESS web page
          (http://ess.r-project.org/) and StatLib
          (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc)

        * Now that info documentation is available, the README.* files
          are no longer supported.  However, they are still distributed
          for what it's worth.

        * ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See XEmacs Installation HOWTO
          (http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html) for details
          (specifically, items 10-15).

        * ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote SAS
          batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
          function key features now supported).  Multiple shells now
          supported so you can run SAS on different computers from
          different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
          ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names.

        * Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
        * ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help
          for SAS; `F12' opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing
          either within emacs, when available, or via an external
          viewer; more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements
          for remote SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for
          remote SAS interactive jobs, see ess-remote

        * ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for
          the S family

        * Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files made by
          doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
        * New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).  The
          S program can determine the environment in which it is
          currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
          when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other
          specific values for S language processes that ESS does not
          start.

        * New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.
          User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
          menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.  This
          feature is still under development.

        * GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS &
          BUGS), (some from Stephen Eglen).

        * XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)

        * XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.

        * Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).

        * should now work even when imenu is not available (for old
          XEmacsen).

        * ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; `C-TAB' is globalized along with
          your function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify
          your SAS library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for
          ess-sas-data-view with SAS code placed in the variable
          ess-sas-data-view-libname, also the dataset name is defaulted
          to the nearest permanent dataset to point; Speedbar support
          now works for permanent datasets, please ignore first./last.;
          new font-locking is now the default with more improvements
          for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
          comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with `F10' which will
          font-lock your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas
          files accessed with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is
          experimental) by setting ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh;
          ess-sas-submit-command and ess-sas-submit-command-options are
          buffer-local so you can have local file variable sections at
          the end of your .sas files to request different executables
          or specify special options and the local file variables are
          re-read at submit instead of only at file open so that if you
          make a change it is picked up immediately;

        * ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.

        * for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.

        * for Rd mode: `C-c C-v' and `switch-process' in menu.
          further, `C-c C-f' prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or
          surrounding a word by things such as \code{.},
          \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.

        * new functions (ess-directory-function) and
          (ess-narrow-to-defun) ess-directory <-> default-directory
          logic (Jeff Mincy).

        * Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
        * S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger
          (Windows))

        * New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)
          Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and
          .log are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension
          collisions).  Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic"
          generation of data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const
          N=" from your data file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.
          Activated by pressing `F12'.

        * Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)

        * You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS
          function-key definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)

        * `C-Submit' a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney
          Sparapani)

        * New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani)
          To get the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to
          nil.  Also available in .log files via `F10'.

        * Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via `F9' (Rodney
          Sparapani) You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas
          for it to work.

        * User-friendly defaults for `sas-program',
          `ess-sas-batch-pre-command' and `ess-sas-batch-post-command'
          as well Customize support for these and other ESS[SAS]
          variables (Rodney Sparapani)

        * `ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via `F11' (Rodney
          Sparapani)

        * Emacs/XEmacs, Unix/Windows issues collectively handled in
          ess-emcs.el

        * defadvice solves problem of missing *ESS* (thanks to Jeff
          Mincy)

        * Improved manual a bit by including things that were only in
          `README'.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:
        * New `ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by
          default.  Inserts `ess-S-assign' (customizable " <- "),
          unless inside string and comments where plain "_" is used
          instead. (MM)

        * Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:
        * Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger)

        * removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the
          sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need
          to fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini)

        * Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler)

        * addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide `M-x
          ess-add-MM-keys' a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign',
          typically " <- ", but customizable. (MMaechler)

          thanks to Martin Maechler.

        * Yet more fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rich Heiberger.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.12:
        * Splus 5.1 stabilized, thanks to Martin Maechler, Bill
          Venables, Chuck Taylor, and others.

        * More fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rodney Sparapani and Rich
          Heiberger.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.11:
        * More fixes to Stata mode, thanks to Brendan Halpin
          (mailto:brendan@essex.ac.uk).

        * fixed bugs in ESS-elsewhere, thanks to many testers

        * README.SPLUS4WIN has DETAILED instructions for S-PLUS 2000,
          thanks to David Brahm (mailto:brahm@alum.mit.edu).

        * able to use inferior iESS mode to communicate directly with a
          running S-Plus 4.x process using the Microsoft DDE protocol.
          We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) `C-c C-n' and related key
          sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the inferior
          S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
          and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript
          mode.  All three modes know the S language, syntax, and
          indentation patterns and provide the syntactic highlighting
          that eases the programming tasks.

1.3 Authors of and contributors to ESS
======================================

The ESS environment is built on the open-source projects of many
contributors, dating back to 1989 where Doug Bates and Ed Kademan wrote
S-mode to edit S and Splus files in GNU Emacs.  Frank Ritter and Mike
Meyer added features, creating version 2.  Meyer and David Smith made
further contributions, creating version 3.  For version 4, David Smith
provided significant enhancements to allow for powerful process
interaction.

   John Sall wrote GNU Emacs macros for SAS source code around 1990.
Tom Cook added functions to submit jobs, review listing and log files,
and produce basic views of a dataset, thus creating a SAS-mode which was
distributed in 1994.

   In 1994, A.J. Rossini extended S-mode to support XEmacs.  Together
with extensions written by Martin Maechler, this became version 4.7 and
supported S, Splus, and R.  In 1995, Rossini extended SAS-mode to work
with XEmacs.

   In 1997, Rossini merged S-mode and SAS-mode into a single Emacs
package for statistical programming; the product of this marriage was
called ESS version 5.  Richard M. Heiberger designed the inferior mode
for interactive SAS and SAS-mode was further integrated into ESS.
Thomas Lumley's Stata mode, written around 1996, was also folded into
ESS.  More changes were made to support additional statistical
languages, particularly XLispStat.

   ESS initially worked only with Unix statistics packages that used
standard-input and standard-output for both the command-line interface
and batch processing.  ESS could not communicate with statistical
packages that did not use this protocol.  This changed in 1998 when
Brian Ripley demonstrated use of the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange
(DDE) protocol with ESS.  Heiberger then used DDE to provide
interactive interfaces for Windows versions of Splus.  In 1999, Rodney
A. Sparapani and Heiberger implemented SAS batch for ESS relying on
files, rather than standard-input/standard-output, for Unix, Windows
and Mac.  In 2001, Sparapani added BUGS batch file processing to ESS
for Unix and Windows.

   * The multiple process code, and the idea for
     `ess-eval-line-and-next-line' are by Rod Ball.

   * Thanks to Doug Bates for many useful suggestions.

   * Thanks to Martin Maechler for reporting and fixing bugs, providing
     many useful comments and suggestions, and for maintaining the ESS

1.4 Getting the latest version of ESS
=====================================

The latest released version of ESS is always available on the web at:
ESS web page (http://ess.r-project.org) or StatLib
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/)

   The latest development version of ESS is available via
`https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/', the ESS Subversion repository.  If
you have a Subversion client (see `http://subversion.tigris.org/'), you
can download the sources using:
     % svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk PATH
   which will put the ESS files into directory PATH.  Later, within
that directory, `svn update' will bring that directory up to date.
Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: ESS SVN site (https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk).
However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the load
when retrieving.

   If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you
can then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

     (load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el")

   Note that https is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is

     Certificate information:
      - Hostname: svn.r-project.org
      - Valid: from Jul 16 08:10:01 2004 GMT until Jul 14 08:10:01 2014 GMT
      - Issuer: Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, CH
      - Fingerprint: c9:5d:eb:f9:f2:56:d1:04:ba:44:61:f8:64:6b:d9:33:3f:93:6e:ad

(currently, there is no "trusted certificate").  You can accept this
certificate permanently and will not be asked about it anymore.

1.5 How to read this manual
===========================

If you need to install ESS, read *note Installation:: for details on
what needs to be done before proceeding to the next chapter.

   In this manual we use the standard notation for describing the
keystrokes used to invoke certain commands.  `C-<chr>' means hold the
CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>. `M-<chr>' means hold the
META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing <chr>. If there is no META,
EDIT or ALT key, instead press and release the ESC key and then type
<chr>.

   All ESS commands can be invoked by typing `M-x command'.  Most of
the useful commands are bound to keystrokes for ease of use.  Also, the
most popular commands are also available through the emacs menubar, and
finally, if available, a small subset are provided on the toolbar.
Where possible, keybindings are similar to other modes in emacs to
strive for a consistent user interface within emacs, regardless of the
details of which programming language is being edited, or process being
run.

   Some commands, such as `M-x R' can accept an optional `prefix'
argument.  To specify the prefix argument, you would type `C-u' before
giving the command.  e.g. If you type `C-u M-x R', you will be asked
for command line options that you wish to invoke the R process with.

   Emacs is often referred to as a `self-documenting' text editor.  This
applies to ESS in two ways.  First, limited documentation about each ESS
command can be obtained by typing `C-h f'.  For example, if you type
`C-h f ess-eval-region', documentation for that command will appear in
a separate *Help* buffer.  Second, a complete list of keybindings that
are available in each ESS mode and brief description of that mode is
available by typing `C-h m' within an ESS buffer.

   Emacs is a versatile editor written in both C and lisp; ESS is
written in the Emacs lisp dialect (termed `elisp') and thus benefits
from the flexible nature of lisp.  In particular, many aspects of ESS
behaviour can be changed by suitable customization of lisp variables.
This manual mentions some of the most frequent variables.  A full list
of them however is available by using the Custom facility within emacs.
(Type `M-x customize-group RET ess RET' to get started.)  *note
Customization:: provides details of common user variables you can
change to customize ESS to your taste, but it is recommended that you
defer this section until you are more familiar with ESS.

File: ess.info,  Node: Unix installation,  Next: Microsoft Windows installation,  Up: Installation

2.1 Unix installation
=====================

For a Unix or Unix-like installation, please follow the next steps.
Retrieve the latest tgz file (`ess-VERSION.tgz') from ESS downloads
area (http://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download).

   _GNU Emacs Simple Instructions:_ for recent versions of Emacs (22.x
or higher) and ESS, the installation process is simple.

  1. Extract all the files from `ess-VERSION.tgz' into the directory
     `PREFIX/site-lisp' where `PREFIX' is appropriate for GNU Emacs on
     your system; `PREFIX' will most likely be either
     `/usr/share/emacs' or `/usr/local/share/emacs' (on Mac OS X,
     `PREFIX' will most likely be something like
     `/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources'):
          GNU tar  % gtar zxf ess-VERSION.tgz -C PREFIX/site-lisp
          Unix tar % gunzip < ess-VERSION.tgz | tar xf - -C PREFIX/site-lisp

  2. Then, add the line
          (require 'ess-site)
     to `~/.emacs' and restart Emacs.

  3. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the simple instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then read further.

  4. It could be that you have an older version of Emacs, some other
     problem with your installation or you are not a sysadmin.
     Whatever the case, you may need to edit `ess-site.el' manually.
     If that is the case, then you should create a directory just for
     ESS like `~/ess' or `/usr/local/ess' and unpack ESS there.  That
     way, your changes to `ess-site.el' will not be lost if you update
     Emacs later.

  5. Replace the line above with
          (load "~/ess/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
     in `~/.emacs' and restart Emacs.

  6. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the manual instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then send a query to
     <ess-help@r-project.org> explicitly describing your problem and
     your environment including operating system, Emacs version, ESS
     version, etc.

   _XEmacs Simple Instructions:_ for recent versions of XEmacs (21.x or
higher) and ESS, the installation process is simple.

  1. Extract all the files from `ess-VERSION.tgz' when you are in the
     current working directory of
     `/usr/local/LOCATION/xemacs/site-packages' which exists for
     packages like ESS where `LOCATION' is `lib' for legacy
     installations and `share' now (and for Mac OS X create a link to
     it from the directory
     `/Applications/XEmacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp'):
          %prompt gtar zxf ess-VERSION.tgz            # for GNU tar
          %prompt gunzip < ess-VERSION.tgz | tar xf - # for Unix tar

  2. Then, add the line
          (require 'ess-site)
     to `~/.xemacs/init.el' and restart XEmacs.

  3. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the simple instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then read further.

  4. It could be that you have an older version of XEmacs, some other
     problem with your installation or you are not a sysadmin.
     Whatever the case, you may need to edit `ess-site.el' manually.
     If that is the case, then you should create a directory just for
     ESS like `~/ess' or `/usr/local/ess' and unpack ESS there.  That
     way, your changes to `ess-site.el' will not be lost if you update
     XEmacs later.

  5. Replace the line above with
          (load "~/ess/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
     in `~/.xemacs/init.el' and restart XEmacs.

  6. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the manual instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then send a query to
     <ess-help@r-project.org> explicitly describing your problem and
     your environment including operating system, XEmacs version, ESS
     version, etc.

  1. (OPTIONAL) COMPILING E-LISP:

     Edit the default locations of `LISPDIR', `INFODIR' and `ETCDIR' in
     Section 1 of `Makeconf' (if you are using XEmacs, then edit the
     XEmacs subsection in Section 1).

     You can compile those files by:
          make all

     When that completes successfully, install the compiled files:
          make install

2.2 Microsoft Windows installation
==================================

For Microsoft Windows installation, please follow the next steps.
Retrieve the latest zip file (`ess-VERSION.zip') from ESS downloads
area (http://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download).

   _GNU Emacs Simple Instructions:_ for recent versions of Emacs (22.x
or higher) and ESS, the installation process is simple.

  1. Extract all the files from `ess-VERSION.zip' (by double clicking
     on it and selecting "Extract all files" which launches the Folders
     Extraction Wizard) into an `ESS' sub-directory of the `site-lisp'
     directory that exists for packages like ESS.  If GNU Emacs was
     installed in the default location, then this directory can be
     found somewhere like `C:\Program Files\GNU
     Emacs\emacs-22.x\site-lisp'

  2. Add the line
          (require 'ess-site)
     to `~/.emacs' and restart Emacs.

  3. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the simple instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then read further.

  4. It could be you have an older version of Emacs or some other
     problem with your installation.  Either way, you may need to edit
     `C:\ess\ess-VERSION\lisp\ess-site.el' manually.  If that is the
     case, then you should create a directory just for ESS like
     `C:\ess' and unpack ESS there.  That way, your changes to
     `C:\ess\ess-VERSION\lisp\ess-site.el' will not be lost if you
     update Emacs later.

  5. Replace the line above with
          (load "C:/ess/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
     in `~/.emacs' and restart Emacs.

  6. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the manual instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then send a query to
     <ess-help@r-project.org> explicitly describing your problem and
     your environment including operating system, Emacs version, ESS
     version, etc.

   _XEmacs Simple Instructions:_ for recent versions of XEmacs (21.x or
higher), the installation process is much simpler.  Hopefully, these
simple instructions will work for you.  If not, then more detailed,
manual instructions follow.

  1. Extract all the files from `ess-VERSION.zip' (by double clicking
     on it and selecting "Extract all files" which launches the Folders
     Extraction Wizard) into the `site-packages' directory that exists
     for packages like ESS.  If XEmacs was installed in the default
     location, then this directory can be found at `C:\Program
     Files\XEmacs\site-packages'.

  2. XEmacs requires the `HOME' environment variable to be defined.
     You can create it by visiting the following dialog: `My
     Computer->Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables'
     In the User variables window, press New.  And create a variable
     named `HOME' with a value something like (you must use forward
     slashes `/' rather than backslashes `\') `c:/Documents and
     Settings/%USERNAME%/Application Data'.  Then press OK for that
     window and press OK for the main window.  _If you also have GNU
     Emacs installed, GNU Emacs will recognize `HOME' and expand `~'
     accordingly._

  3. Now launch XEmacs and do a `C-x C-f' followed by a `~'.  From the
     Subdir menu, select Create Directory, and enter `.xemacs'

  4. Add the line
          (require 'ess-site)
     to `~/.xemacs/init.el' and restart XEmacs.

  5. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the simple instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then read further.

  6. It could be you have an older version of XEmacs or some other
     problem with your installation.  Either way, you may need to edit
     `C:\ess\ess-VERSION\lisp\ess-site.el' manually.  If that is the
     case, then you should create a directory just for ESS like
     `C:\ess' and unpack ESS there.  That way, your changes to
     `C:\ess\ess-VERSION\lisp\ess-site.el' will not be lost if you
     update XEmacs later.

  7. Replace the line above with
          (load "C:/ess/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
     in `~/.xemacs/init.el' and restart XEmacs.

  8. If you see a buffer named `*ESS*', then the manual instructions
     were most likely successful.  If not, then send a query to
     <ess-help@r-project.org> explicitly describing your problem and
     your environment including operating system, XEmacs version, ESS
     version, etc.

   Now, you should be ready to use ESS.  For example, to edit
statistical programs, load the files with the requisite extensions
(".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or "Q" for S-PLUS, ".r" or ".R" for
R, and ".lsp" for XLispStat).  One further step is needed if you wish to
run statistical processes, see below.

   To run statistical processes under ESS, Windows users will need to
make sure that the directories for the software they will be using is
in the PATH environment variable.

   On Windows NT/2000/XP, add the directories to the PATH using the `My
Computer->Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables' menu.
Note that the directory containing the program is added to the PATH,
not the program itself.  One such line is needed for each software
program.  Be sure to use the abbreviation `progra~1' and not the long
version with embedded blanks as this may cause problems.  Also, make
sure to use backslashes `\' since Windows requires them.

   An alternative, for R users, is that rather than adjusting the PATH
variable, you can add the following to your emacs initialization file
(and restart emacs):
     (setq inferior-R-program-name "c:/progra~1/R/R-2.2.1/bin/Rterm.exe")
   This assumes that you have installed R-2.2.1 in the default location.
Change the path otherwise to point to other locations.

   Windows users who place S-PLUS anywhere other than the default
location will also need to add the following three lines (properly
adjusted for their location):
     (setq-default inferior-S+6-program-name
         "c:/progra~1/Insightful/SPLUS70/cmd/Splus")
     (setq-default inferior-Sqpe+6-SHOME-name
         "c:/progra~1/Insightful/SPLUS70")
     (setq-default inferior-Sqpe+6-program-name
         "c:/progra~1/Insightful/SPLUS70/cmd/Sqpe.exe")
   The above example uses the default location of S-PLUS in
`c:\progra~1\Insightful'.  Please note that ESS considers S-PLUS 6, 7,
and 8 to be variants of S+6.

   These users may also need to modify the emacs variable
`ess-SHOME-versions' to match their installation in order to get the
full set of S-PLUS versions on their machine into the ESS menu.

   To start the S-PLUS [678].x GUI from ESS under emacs:
  1. If you use Cygwin bash as your primary shell, then
          M-x S
          (or `M-x S+6').

  2. If you use the MSDOS prompt window as your primary shell, then
          M-x S+6-msdos
     You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will propose
your current directory as the default.  ESS will start the S-PLUS GUI.
There will be slight delay during which emacs is temporarily frozen.
ESS will arrange for communication with the S-PLUS GUI using the DDE
protocol.  Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer containing your
S program (for example, `myfile.s') to the S-PLUS Commands Window with
the `C-c C-n' or `C-c C-r' keys.  (If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or
2000,\ then use `M-x S+4' or `M-x S+4-msdos'.)

   To start an S-PLUS [678].x session inside an emacs buffer--and
without the S-PLUS GUI:
     M-x Sqpe
     (or `M-x Sqpe+6').
   This works with both the bash and msdos shells.  You will then be
asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory as
the default.  You get Unix-like behavior, in particular the entire
transcript is available for emacs-style search commands.  Send lines or
regions from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
`myfile.s') to the *S+6* buffer with the `C-c C-n' or `C-c C-r' keys.
Interactive graphics are available with Sqpe by using the java library
supplied with S-PLUS 6.1 and newer releases.  Enter the commands:
     library(winjava)
     java.graph()
   Graphs can be saved from the `java.graph' device in several formats,
but not PostScript.   If you need a PostScript file you will need to
open a separate `postscript' device.  (If you are still using S-PLUS
4.x or 2000, then use `M-x Sqpe+4'.)

   To connect to an already running S-PLUS GUI (started, for example,
from the S-PLUS icon):
     M-x S+6-existing
   or
     M-x S+6-msdos-existing
   You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will propose
your current directory as the default.  ESS will arrange for
communication with the already running S-PLUS GUI using the DDE
protocol.  Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer containing your
S program (for example, `myfile.s') to the S-PLUS Commands Window with
the `C-c C-n' or `C-c C-r' keys.  (If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or
2000,  then use `M-x S+4-existing' or `M-x S+4-msdos-existing'.)

   If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
     M-x R

   XLispStat can not currently be run with
     M-x XLS
   Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat *Listener*
Window under Microsoft Windows.

2.3 Requirements
================

ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata, OpenBUGS and JAGS.

   ESS supports current/recent versions of GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  Most
notably, the GNU Emacs 22 series and XEmacs 21.4.14 or higher
(beta/pre-release versions are NOT SUPPORTED).

   To build the PDF documentation, you will need a version of TeX Live
or texinfo that includes texi2dvi (BEWARE: recent TeX Live, and some
texinfo RPMs, do NOT include texi2dvi).

3 Interacting with statistical programs
***************************************

As well as using ESS to edit your source files for statistical programs,
you can use ESS to run these statistical programs.  In this chapter, we
mostly will refer by example to running S from within emacs.  The emacs
convention is to name such processes running under its control as
`inferior processes'.  This term can be slightly misleading, in which
case these processes can be thought of `interactive processes'.  Either
way, we use the term `iESS' to refer to the Emacs mode used to interact
with statistical programs.

3.1 Starting an ESS process
===========================

To start an S session on Unix or on Windows when you use the Cygwin
bash shell, simply type `M-x S RET'.

   To start an S session on Windows when you use the MSDOS prompt
shell, simply type `M-x S+6-msdos RET'.

   S will then (by default) ask the question
     S starting data directory?
   Enter the name of the directory you wish to start S from (that is,
the directory you would have `cd''d to before starting S from the
shell).  This directory should have a `.Data' subdirectory.

   You will then be popped into a buffer with name `*S*' which will be
used for interacting with the ESS process, and you can start entering
commands.


File: ess.info,  Node: Multiple ESS processes,  Next: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Prev: Starting up,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.2 Running more than one ESS process
=====================================

ESS allows you to run more than one ESS process simultaneously in the
same session.  Each process has a name and a number; the initial process (process
1) is simply named (using S-PLUS as an example) `S+3:1'.  The name of
the process is shown in the mode line in square brackets (for example,
`[S+3:2]'); this is useful if the process buffer is renamed.  Without a
prefix argument, `M-x S' starts a new ESS process, using the first
available process number.  With a prefix argument (for R), `C-u M-x R'
allows for the specification of command line options.

   You can switch to any active ESS process with the command `M-x
ess-request-a-process'.  Just enter the name of the process you
require; completion is provided over the names of all running S
processes.  This is a good command to consider binding to a global key.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Next: S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere,  Prev: Multiple ESS processes,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.3 ESS processes on Remote Computers
=====================================

ESS works with processes on remote computers as easily as with
processes on the local machine.  The recommended way to access a
statistical program on remote computer is to start it from a telnet or
ssh buffer and then connect ESS to that buffer.

  1. Start a new telnet or ssh buffer and connect to the remote computer
     (e.g. use `M-x telnet' or `M-x ssh'; ssh.el is available at
     `ftp://ftp.splode.com/pub/users/friedman/emacs-lisp/ssh.el').

  2. Start the ESS process on the remote machine, for example with one
     of the commands `Splus', or `R', or `sas -stdio'.

  3. Enter the ESS command `M-x ess-remote'.  You will be prompted for
     a program name.  Enter `sp6' or `r' or `sas' or another valid
     name.  Your telnet process is now known to ESS.  All the usual ESS
     commands (`C-c C-n' and its relatives) now work with the S
     language processes.  For SAS you need to use a different command
     `C-c i' (that is a regular `i', not a `C-i') to send lines from
     your `myfile.sas' to the remote SAS process.  `C-c i' sends lines
     over invisibly.  With ess-remote you get teletype behavior--the
     data input, the log, and the listing all appear in the same
     buffer.  To make this work, you need to end every PROC and DATA
     step with a "RUN;" statement.  The "RUN;" statement is what tells
     SAS that it should process the preceding input statements.

  4. Graphics (interactive) on the remote machine.  If you run X11
     (*Note X11::, X-windows) on both the local and remote machines
     then you should be able to display the graphs locally by setting
     the `DISPLAY' environment variable appropriately.  Windows users
     can download `xfree86' from cygwin.

  5. Graphics (static) on the remote machine.  If you don't run the X
     window system on the local machine, then you can write graphics to
     a file on the remote machine, and display the file in a graphics
     viewer on the local machine.  Most statistical software can write
     one or more of postscript, GIF, or JPEG files.  Depending on the
     versions of emacs and the operating system that you are running,
     emacs itself may display `.gif' and `.jpg' files.  Otherwise, a
     graphics file viewer will be needed.  Ghostscript/ghostview may be
     downloaded to display `.ps' and `.eps' files.  Viewers for GIF and
     JPEG are usually included with operating systems.  *Note
     ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch processing::, for more
     information on using the F12 key for displaying graphics files
     with SAS.

   Should you or a colleague inadvertently start a statistical process
in an ordinary `*shell*' buffer, the `ess-remote' command can be used
to convert it to an ESS buffer and allow you to use the ESS commands
with it.

   We have two older commands, now deprecated, for accessing ESS
processes on remote computers.  *Note S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere::.


File: ess.info,  Node: S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere,  Next: Customizing startup,  Prev: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.4 S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere
=================================

These commands are now deprecated.  We recommend `ess-remote'.  We have
two versions of the elsewhere function.  `S+elsewhere' is specific for
the S-Plus program.  The more general function `ESS-elsewhere' is not
as stable.

  1. Enter `M-x S+elsewhere'.  You will be prompted for a starting
     directory.  I usually give it my project directory on the local
     machine, say  `~myname/myproject/'

     Or enter `M-x ESS-elsewhere'.  You will be prompted for an ESS
     program and for a starting directory.  I usually give it my project
     directory on the local machine, say `~myname/myproject/'

  2. The `*S+3*' buffer will appear with a prompt from the local
     operating system (the unix prompt on a unix workstation or with
     cygwin bash on a PC, or the msdos prompt on a PC without bash).
     emacs may freeze because the cursor is at the wrong place.
     Unfreeze it with `C-g' then move the cursor to the end with `M->'.
     With `S+elsewhere' the buffer name is based on the name of the ESS
     program.

  3. Enter `telnet myname@other.machine' (or `ssh
     myname@other.machine').  You will be prompted for your password on
     the remote machine.  Use `M-x send-invisible' before typing the
     password itself.

  4. Before starting the ESS process, type `stty -echo nl' at the unix
     prompt.  The `-echo' turns off the echo, the `nl' turns off the
     newline that you see as `^M'.

  5. You are now talking to the unix prompt on the other machine in the
     `*S+3*' buffer.  cd into the directory for the current project and
     start the ESS process by entering `Splus' or `R' or `sas -stdio'
     as appropriate.  If you can login remotely to your Windows 2000,
     then you should be able to run `Sqpe' on the Windows machine.  I
     haven't tested this and noone has reported their tests to me.  You
     will not be able to run the GUI through this text-only connection.

  6. Once you get the S or R or SAS prompt, then you are completely
     connected.  All the `C-c C-n' and related commands work correctly
     in sending commands from `myfile.s' or `myfile.r' on the PC to the
     `*S+3*' buffer running the S or R or SAS program on the remote
     machine.

  7. Graphics on the remote machine works fine.  If you run the X window
     system on the remote unix machine you should be able to display
     them in `xfree86' on your PC.  If you don't run X11, then you can
     write graphics to the postscript device and copy it to your PC
     with dired and display it with ghostscript.


File: ess.info,  Node: Customizing startup,  Prev: S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.5 Changing the startup actions
================================

If you do not wish ESS to prompt for a starting directory when starting
a new process, set the variable `ess-ask-for-ess-directory' to `nil'.
In this case, the starting directory will be set using one of the
following methods:

  1. If the variable `ess-directory-function' stores the name of a
     function, the value returned by this function is used.  The
     default for this variable is nil.

  2. Otherwise, if the variable `ess-directory' stores the name of a
     directory (ending in a slash), this value is used.  The default
     for this variable is nil.

  3. Otherwise, the working directory of the current buffer is used.


   If `ess-ask-for-ess-directory' has a non-`nil' value (as it does by
default) then the value determined by the above rules provides the
default when prompting for the starting directory.  Incidentally,
`ess-directory' is an ideal variable to set in `ess-pre-run-hook'.

   If you like to keep a record of your S sessions, set the variable
`ess-ask-about-transfile' to `t', and you will be asked for a filename
for the transcript before the ESS process starts.

 -- User Option: ess-ask-about-transfile
     If non-`nil', as for a file name in which to save the session
     transcript.

   Enter the name of a file in which to save the transcript at the
prompt.  If the file doesn't exist it will be created (and you should
give it a file name ending in `.St'); if the file already exists the
transcript will be appended to the file.  (Note: if you don't set this
variable but you still want to save the transcript, you can still do it
later -- *note Saving transcripts::.)

   Once these questions are answered (if they are asked at all) the S
process itself is started by calling the program name specified in the
variable `inferior-ess-program'.  If you need to pass any arguments to
this program, they may be specified in the variable
`inferior-S_PROGRAM_NAME-args' (e.g. if `inferior-ess-program' is
`"S+"' then the variable to set is `inferior-S+-args'.  It is not
normally necessary to pass arguments to the S program; in particular do
not pass the `-e' option to `Splus', since ESS provides its own command
history mechanism.

   By default, the new process will be displayed in the same window in
the current frame.  If you wish your S process to appear in a separate
variable, customize the variable `inferior-ess-own-frame'.
Alternatively, change `inferior-ess-same-window' if you wish the
process to appear within another window of the current frame.

4 Interacting with the ESS process
**********************************

The primary function of the ESS package is to provide an easy-to-use
front end to the S interpreter.  This is achieved by running the S
process from within an Emacs buffer, so that the Emacs editing commands
are available to correct mistakes in commands, etc.  The features of
Inferior S mode are similar to those provided by the standard Emacs
shell mode (*note Shell Mode: (emacs)Shell Mode.).  Command-line
completion of S objects and a number of `hot keys' for commonly-used S
commands are also provided for ease of typing.

File: ess.info,  Node: Command-line editing,  Next: Completion,  Prev: Entering commands,  Up: Entering commands

4.1 Entering commands and fixing mistakes
=========================================

Sending a command to the ESS process is as simple as typing it in and
pressing the <RETURN> key:

   * `RET' (`inferior-ess-send-input')
     Send the command on the current line to the ESS process.

   If you make a typing error before pressing `RET' all the usual Emacs
editing commands are available to correct it (*note Basic:
(emacs)Basic.).  Once the command has been corrected you can press
<RETURN> (even if the cursor is not at the end of the line) to send the
corrected command to the ESS process.

   ESS provides some other commands which are useful for fixing
mistakes:

   * `C-c C-w' (`backward-kill-word')
     Deletes the previous word (such as an object name) on the command
     line.

   * `C-c C-u' (`comint-kill-input')
     Deletes everything from the prompt to point.  Use this to abandon a
     command you have not yet sent to the ESS process.

   * `C-c C-a' (`comint-bol')
     Move to the beginning of the line, and then skip forwards past the
     prompt, if any.

   *Note Shell Mode: (emacs)Shell Mode, for other commands relevant to
entering input.


File: ess.info,  Node: Completion,  Next: Completion details,  Prev: Command-line editing,  Up: Entering commands

4.2 Completion of object names
==============================

In the process buffer, the <TAB> key is for completion, similar to that
provided by Shell Mode for filenames.  In Inferior S mode, pressing the
<TAB> key when the cursor is following the first few characters of an
object name _completes_ the object name; if the cursor is following a
file name `TAB' completes the file name.

   * `TAB' (`comint-dynamic-complete')
     Complete the S object name or filename before point.

   When the cursor is just after a partially-completed object name,
pressing <TAB> provides completion in a similar fashion to `tcsh' except
that completion is performed over all known S object names instead of
file names.  ESS maintains a list of all objects known to S at any
given time, which basically consists of all objects (functions and
datasets) in every attached directory listed by the `search()' command along
with the component objects of attached data frames (if your version of
S supports them).

   For example, consider the three functions (available in Splus version
3.0) called `binomplot()', `binom.test()' and `binomial()'.  Typing
`bin TAB' after the S prompt will insert the characters `om',
completing the longest prefix (`binom') which distinguishes these three
commands.  Pressing `TAB' once more provides a list of the three
commands which have this prefix, allowing you to add more characters
(say, `.') which specify the function you desire.  After entering more
characters pressing `TAB' yet again will complete the object name up to
uniqueness, etc.  If you just wish to see what completions exist without
adding any extra characters, type `M-?'.

   * `M-?' (`ess-list-object-completions')
     List all possible completions of the object name at point.

   ESS also provides completion over the components of named lists
accessed using the `$' notation, to any level of nested lists.  This
feature is particularly useful for checking what components of a list
object exist while partway through entering a command: simply type the
object name and `$' and press `TAB' to see the names of existing list
components for that object.  

   Completion is also provided over file names, which is particularly
useful when using S functions such as `get()' or `scan()' which require
fully expanded file names.  Whenever the cursor is within an S string,
pressing `TAB' completes the file name before point.  Since ESS 5.11,
it no longer also expands any `~' or environment variable references.

   If the cursor is not in a string and does not follow a (partial)
object name, the <TAB> key has a third use: it expands history
references.  *Note History expansion::.

4.3 Completion details
======================

ESS automatically keeps track of any objects added or deleted to the
system (such as new objects created, or directories added to the search
list) to make completion as accurate as possible.  Whenever ESS notices
that search list has changed (1)  when you attach a directory or data
frame, the objects associated with it immediately become available for a
completion; when it is detached completion is no longer available on
those objects.

   To maintain a list of accessible objects for completion, ESS needs to
determine which objects are contained in each directory or data frame on
the search list.  This is done at the start of each S session, by
running the `objects()' command on every element of the search list.

   Efficiency in completion is gained by maintaining a cache of objects
currently known to S; when a new object becomes available or is deleted,
only one component of the cache corresponding to the associated
directory needs to be refreshed.  If ESS ever becomes confused about
what objects are available for completion (such as when if refuses to
complete an object you *know* is there), the command `M-x ess-resynch' forces
the _entire_ cache to be refreshed, which should fix the problem.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The variable `ess-change-sp-regexp' is a regular expression
matching commands which change the search list.  You will need to
modify this variable if you have defined custom commands (other than
`attach', `detach', `collection' or `library') which modify the search
list.


File: ess.info,  Node: Transcript,  Next: Command History,  Prev: Completion details,  Up: Entering commands

4.4 Manipulating the transcript
===============================

Most of the time, the cursor spends most of its time at the bottom of
the ESS process buffer, entering commands.  However all the input and
output from the current (and previous) ESS sessions is stored in the
process buffer (we call this the transcript) and often we want to move
back up through the buffer, to look at the output from previous
commands for example.

   Within the process buffer, a paragraph is defined as the prompt, the
command after the prompt, and the output from the command.  Thus `M-{'
and `M-}' move you backwards and forwards, respectively, through
commands in the transcript.  A particularly useful command is `M-h'
(`mark-paragraph') which will allow you to mark a command and its
entire output (for deletion, perhaps).  For more information about
paragraph commands, *note Paragraphs: (emacs)Paragraphs.

   If an ESS process finishes and you restart it in the same process
buffer, the output from the new ESS process appears after the output
from the first ESS process separated by a form-feed (`^L') character.
Thus pages in the ESS process buffer correspond to ESS sessions.  Thus,
for example, you may use `C-x [' and `C-x ]' to move backward and
forwards through ESS sessions in a single ESS process buffer.  For more
information about page commands, *note Pages: (emacs)Pages.

4.4.1 Manipulating the output from the last command
---------------------------------------------------

Viewing the output of the command you have just entered is a common
occurrence and ESS provides a number of facilities for doing this.
Whenever a command produces a longish output, it is possible that the
window will scroll, leaving the next prompt near the middle of the
window.  The first part of the command output may have scrolled off the
top of the window, even though the entire output would fit in the window
if the prompt were near the bottom of the window.  If this happens, you
can use the command

   * `C-c C-e' (`comint-show-maximum-output')
     Move to the end of the buffer, and place cursor on bottom line of
     window.

to make more of the last output visible.  (To make this happen
automatically for all inputs, set the variable
`comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input' to `t'.)

   If the first part of the output is still obscured, use 
   * `C-c C-r' (`comint-show-output')
     Moves cursor to the previous command line and and places it at the
     top of the window.

to view it.  Finally, if you want to discard the last command output
altogether, use

   * `C-c C-o' (`comint-kill-output')
     Deletes everything from the last command to the current prompt.

to delete it.  Use this command judiciously to keep your transcript to a
more manageable size.

4.4.2 Viewing older commands
----------------------------

If you want to view the output from more historic commands than the
previous command, commands are also provided to move backwards and
forwards through previously entered commands in the process buffer:

   * `C-c C-p' (`comint-previous-input')
     Moves point to the preceding command in the process buffer.

   * `C-c C-n' (`comint-next-input')
     Moves point to the next command in the process buffer.

Note that these two commands are analogous to `C-p' and `C-n' but apply
to command lines rather than text lines.  And just like `C-p' and
`C-n', passing a prefix argument to these commands means to move to the
ARG'th next (or previous) command.  (These commands are also discussed
in *note Shell History Copying: (emacs)Shell History Copying.)

   There are also two similar commands (not bound to any keys by
default) which move to preceding or succeeding commands, but which
first prompt for a regular expression (*note Syntax of Regular
Expression: (emacs)Regexps.), and then moves to the next (previous)
command matching the pattern.

   * `(comint-backward-matching-input regexp arg)'
     `(comint-forward-matching-input regexp arg)'
     Search backward (forward) through the transcript buffer for the
     ARG'th previous (next) command matching REGEXP.  ARG is the prefix
     argument; REGEXP is prompted for in the minibuffer.

4.4.3 Re-submitting commands from the transcript
------------------------------------------------

When moving through the transcript, you may wish to re-execute some of
the commands you find there.  ESS provides three commands to do this;
these commands may be used whenever the cursor is within a command line
in the transcript (if the cursor is within some command _output_, an
error is signalled).  Note all three commands involve the <RETURN> key.

   * `RET' (`inferior-ess-send-input')
     Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
     execute it.

   * `C-c RET' (`comint-copy-old-input')
     Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, but
     don't execute it.  Leaves the cursor on the command line so that
     the copied command may be edited.

   * `M-RET' (`ess-transcript-send-command-and-move')
     Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
     execute it.  Moves the cursor to the following command.

   When the cursor is not after the current prompt, the <RETURN> key
has a slightly different behavior than usual.  Pressing `RET' on any
line containing a command that you entered (i.e. a line beginning with a
prompt) sends that command to the ESS process once again.  If you wish
to edit the command before executing it, use `C-c RET' instead; it
copies the command to the current prompt but does not execute it,
allowing you to edit it before submitting it.

   These two commands leave the cursor at the new command line, allowing
you to continue with interactive use of S.  If you wish to resubmit a
series of commands from the transcript, consider using `M-RET' instead,
which leaves the cursor at the command line following the one you
re-submitted.  Thus by using `M-RET' repeatedly, you can re-submit a
whole series of commands.

   These commands work even if if the current line is a continuation
line (i.e. the prompt is `+' instead of `>') -- in this case all the
lines that form the multi-line command are concatenated together and
the resulting command is sent to the ESS process (currently this is the
only way to resubmit a multi-line command to the ESS process in one
go).  If the current line does not begin with a prompt, an error is
signalled.  This feature, coupled with the command-based motion
commands described above, could be used as a primitive history
mechanism.  ESS provides a more sophisticated mechanism, however, which
is described in *note Command History::.

4.4.4 Keeping a record of your S session
----------------------------------------

To keep a record of your S session in a disk file, use the Emacs
command `C-x C-w' (`write-file') to attach a file to the ESS process
buffer.  The name of the process buffer will (probably) change to the
name of the file, but this is not a problem.  You can still use S as
usual; just remember to save the file before you quit Emacs with `C-x
C-s'.  You can make ESS prompt you for a filename in which to save the
transcript every time you start S by setting the variable `ess-ask-about-transfile'
to `t'; see *note Customizing startup::.  We recommend you save your
transcripts with filenames that end in `.St'.  There is a special mode
(ESS transcript mode -- *note Transcript Mode::) for editing transcript
files which is automatically selected for files with this suffix.

   S transcripts can get very large, so some judicious editing is
appropriate if you are saving it in a file.  Use `C-c C-o' whenever a
command produces excessively long output (printing large arrays, for
example).  Delete erroneous commands (and the resulting error messages
or other output) by moving to the command (or its output) and typing
`M-h C-w'.  Also, remember that `C-c C-e' (and other hot keys) may be
used for commands whose output you do not wish to appear in the
transcript.  These suggestions are appropriate even if you are not
saving your transcript to disk, since the larger the transcript, the
more memory your Emacs process will use on the host machine.

   Finally, if you intend to produce S source code (suitable for using
with `source()' or inclusion in an S function) from a transcript, then
the command `M-x ess-transcript-clean-region' may be of use.  This
command works in any Emacs buffer, and removes all prompts and command
output from an ESS transcript within the current region, leaving only
the commands.  Don't forget to remove any erroneous commands first!


File: ess.info,  Node: Command History,  Next: History expansion,  Prev: Transcript,  Up: Entering commands

4.5 Command History
===================

ESS provides easy-to-use facilities for re-executing or editing previous
commands.  An input history of the last few commands is maintained (by
default the last 50 commands are stored, although this can be changed by
setting the variable `comint-input-ring-size' in `inferior-ess-mode-hook'.)
The simplest history commands simply select the next and previous
commands in the input history:

   * `M-p' (`comint-previous-input')
     Select the previous command in the input history.

   * `M-n'  (`comint-next-input')
     Select the next command in the input history.

For example, pressing `M-p' once will re-enter the last command into
the process buffer after the prompt but does not send it to the ESS
process, thus allowing editing or correction of the command before the
ESS process sees it.  Once corrections have been made, press `RET' to
send the edited command to the ESS process.

   If you want to select a particular command from the history by
matching it against a regular expression (*note Syntax of Regular
Expression: (emacs)Regexps.), to search for a particular variable name
for example, these commands are also available:

   * `M-r' (`comint-previous-matching-input')
     Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the
     input history for a command matching the expression.

   * `M-s' (`comint-next-matching-input')
     Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the
     input history for a command matching the expression.

A common type of search is to find the last command that began with a
particular sequence of characters; the following two commands provide an
easy way to do this:

   * `A-M-r' (`comint-previous-matching-input-from-input')
     Select the previous command in the history which matches the string
     typed so far.

   * `A-M-s' (`comint-next-matching-input-from-input')
     Select the next command in the history which matches the string
     typed so far.

Instead of prompting for a regular expression to match against, as they
instead select commands starting with those characters already entered.
For instance, if you wanted to re-execute the last `attach()' command,
you may only need to type `att' and then `A-M-r' and `RET'.  (Note: you
may not have an <ALT> key on your keyboard, in which case it may be a
good idea to bind these commands to some other keys.)

   *Note Shell History Ring: (emacs)Shell Ring, for a more detailed
discussion of the history mechanism.


File: ess.info,  Node: History expansion,  Next: Hot keys,  Prev: Command History,  Up: Entering commands

4.6 References to historical commands
=====================================

Instead of searching through the command history using the command
described in the previous section, you can alternatively refer to a
historical command directly using a notation very similar to that used
in `csh'.  History references are introduced by a `!' or `^' character
and have meanings as follows:

`!!'
     The immediately previous command

`!-N'
     The Nth previous command

`!text'
     The last command beginning with the string `text'

`!?text'
     The last command containing the string `text'

   In addition, you may follow the reference with a "word designator"
to select particular "words" of the input.  A word is defined as a
sequence of characters separated by whitespace.  (You can modify this
definition by setting the value of `comint-delimiter-argument-list' to
a list of characters that are allowed to separate words and themselves
form words.)  Words are numbered beginning with zero.  The word
designator usually begins with a `:' (colon) character; however it may
be omitted if the word reference begins with a `^', `$', `*' or `-'.
If the word is to be selected from the previous command, the second `!'
character can be omitted from the event specification.  For instance,
`!!:1' and `!:1' both refer to the first word of the previous command,
while `!!$' and `!$' both refer to the last word in the previous
command.  The format of word designators is as follows:

`0'
     The zeroth word (i.e. the first one on the command line)

`N'
     The Nth word, where N is a number

`^'
     The first word (i.e. the second one on the command line)

`$'
     The last word

`X-Y'
     A range of words; `-Y' abbreviates `0-Y'

`*'
     All the words except the zeroth word, or nothing if the command
     had just one word (the zeroth)

`X*'
     Abbreviates X-$

`X-'
     Like `X*', but omitting the last word

   In addition, you may surround the entire reference except for the
first `!' by braces to allow it to be followed by other (non-whitespace)
characters (which will be appended to the expanded reference).

   Finally, ESS also provides quick substitution; a reference like
`^old^new^' means "the last command, but with the first occurrence of
the string `old' replaced with the string `new'" (the last `^' is
optional).  Similarly, `^old^' means "the last command, with the first
occurrence of the string `old' deleted" (again, the last `^' is
optional).

   To convert a history reference as described above to an input
suitable for S, you need to "expand" the history reference, using the
<TAB> key.  For this to work, the cursor must be preceded by a space
(otherwise it would try to complete an object name) and not be within a
string (otherwise it would try to complete a filename).  So to expand
the history reference, type `SPC TAB'.  This will convert the history
reference into an S command from the history, which you can then edit
or press <RET> to execute.

   For example, to execute the last command that referenced the variable
`data', type `!?data SPC TAB RET'.

4.7 Hot keys for common commands
================================

ESS provides a number of commands for executing the commonly used
functions.  These commands below are basically information-gaining
commands (such as `objects()' or `search()') which tend to clutter up
your transcript and for this reason some of the hot keys display their
output in a temporary buffer instead of the process buffer by default.
This behavior is controlled by the variable
`ess-execute-in-process-buffer' which, if non-`nil', means that these
commands will produce their output in the process buffer instead.  In
any case, passing a prefix argument to the commands (with `C-u') will
reverse the meaning of `ess-execute-in-process-buffer' for that
command, i.e. the output will be displayed in the process buffer if it
usually goes to a temporary buffer, and vice-versa.  These are the hot
keys that behave in this way:

   * `C-c C-x' (`ess-execute-objects')
     Sends the `objects()' command to the ESS process.  A prefix
     argument specifies the position on the search list (use a negative
     argument to toggle `ess-execute-in-process-buffer' as well).  A
     quick way to see what objects are in your working directory.  

   * `C-c C-s' (`ess-execute-search')
     Sends the `search()' command to the ESS process.  

   * `C-c C-e' (`ess-execute')
     Prompt for an ESS expression, and evaluate it.

   `ess-execute' may seem pointless when you could just type the
command in anyway, but it proves useful for `spot' calculations which
would otherwise clutter your transcript, or for evaluating an expression
while partway through entering a command.  You can also use this command
to generate new hot keys using the Emacs keyboard macro facilities;
*note Keyboard Macros: (emacs)Keyboard Macros.  

   The following hot keys do not use `ess-execute-in-process-buffer' to
decide where to display the output -- they either always display in the
process buffer or in a separate buffer, as indicated:

   * `C-c C-a' (`ess-execute-attach')
     Prompts for a directory to attach to the ESS process with the
     `attach()' command.  If a numeric prefix argument is given it is
     used as the position on the search list to attach the directory;
     otherwise the S default of 2 is used.  The `attach()' command
     actually executed appears in the process buffer.

   * `C-c C-l' (`ess-load-file')
     Prompts for a file to load into the ESS process using `source()'.
     If there is an error during loading, you can jump to the error in
     the file with `C-x `' (`ess-parse-errors').  *Note Error
     Checking::, for more details.

   * `C-c C-v' (`ess-display-help-on-object')
     Pops up a help buffer for an S object or function.  See *note
     Help:: for more details.

   * `C-c C-q' (`ess-quit')
     Sends the `q()' command to the ESS process (or `(exit)' to the XLS
     process), and cleans up any temporary buffers (such as help
     buffers or edit buffers) you may have created along the way.  Use
     this command when you have finished your S session instead of
     simply typing `q()' yourself, otherwise you will need to issue the
     command `M-x ess-cleanup' command explicitly to make sure that all
     the files that need to be saved have been saved, and that all the
     temporary buffers have been killed.

4.8 Is the Statistical Process running under ESS?
=================================================

For the S languages (S, S-Plus, R) ESS sets an option in the current
process that programs in the language can check to determine the
environment in which they are currently running.

   ESS sets `options(STERM="iESS")' for S language processes running in
an inferior `iESS[S]' or `iESS[R]' buffer.

   ESS sets `options(STERM="ddeESS")' for independent S-Plus for Windows
processes running in the GUI and communicating with ESS via the DDE
(Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol through a `ddeESS[S]' buffer.

   Other values of `options()$STERM' that we recommend are:

   * `length':     Fixed length xterm or telnet window.

   * `scrollable': Unlimited length xterm or telnet window.

   * `server':     S-Plus Stat Server.

   * `BATCH':      BATCH.

   * `Rgui':       R GUI.

   * `Commands':   S-Plus GUI without DDE interface to ESS.

   Additional values may be recommended in the future as new interaction
protocols are created.  Unlike the values `iESS' and `ddeESS', ESS
can't set these other values since the S language program is not under
the control of ESS.


File: ess.info,  Node: Emacsclient,  Next: Other,  Prev: Statistical Process running in ESS?,  Up: Entering commands

4.9 Using emacsclient
=====================

When starting R or S under Unix, ESS sets
`options(editor="emacsclient")'.  (Under Microsoft Windows, it will use
gnuclient.exe rather than emacsclient, but the same principle applies.)
Within your R session, for example, if you have a function called
`iterator', typing `fix(iterator)', will show that function in a
temporary Emacs buffer.  You can then correct the function.  When you
kill the buffer, the definition of the function is updated.  Using
`edit()' rather than `fix()' means that the function is not updated.
Finally, the S function `page(x)' will also show a text representation
of the object `x' in a temporary Emacs buffer.


File: ess.info,  Node: Other,  Prev: Emacsclient,  Up: Entering commands

4.10 Other commands provided by inferior-ESS
============================================

The following commands are also provided in the process buffer:

   * `C-c C-c' (`comint-interrupt-subjob')
     Sends a Control-C signal to the ESS process.  This has the effect
     of aborting the current command.

   * `C-c C-z' (`ess-abort')
     Sends a STOP signal to the ESS process, killing it immediately.
     It's not a good idea to use this, in general: Neither `q()' nor
     `.Last' will be executed and device drivers will not finish
     cleanly.  This command is provided as a safety to
     `comint-stop-subjob', which is usually bound to `C-c C-z'.  If you
     want to quit from S, use `C-c C-q' (`ess-quit') instead.  

   * `C-c C-d' (`ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer')
     Prompts for an object to be edited in an edit buffer.  *Note
     Editing::.

   Other commands available in Inferior S mode are discussed in *note
Shell Mode: (emacs)Shell Mode.

5 Manipulating saved transcript files
*************************************

Inferior S mode records the transcript (the list of all commands
executed, and their output) in the process buffer, which can be saved as
a "transcript file", which should normally have the suffix `.St'.  The
most obvious use for a transcript file is as a static record of the
actions you have performed in a particular S session.  Sometimes,
however, you may wish to re-execute commands recorded in the transcript
file by submitting them to a running ESS process.  This is what
Transcript Mode is for.

   If you load file a with the suffix `.St' into Emacs, it is placed in
S Transcript Mode.  Transcript Mode is similar to Inferior S mode
(*note Entering commands::): paragraphs are defined as a command and
its output, and you can move though commands either with the paragraph
commands or with `C-c C-p' and `C-c C-n'.

* Menu:

* Resubmit::                    Resubmitting commands from the transcript file
* Clean::                       Cleaning transcript files


File: ess.info,  Node: Resubmit,  Next: Clean,  Prev: Transcript Mode,  Up: Transcript Mode

5.1 Resubmitting commands from the transcript file
==================================================

Three commands are provided to re-submit command lines from the
transcript file to a running ESS process.  They are:

   * `RET' (`ess-transcript-send-command')
     Send the current command line to the ESS process, and execute it.  

   * `C-c RET' (`ess-transcript-copy-command')
     Copy the current command to the ESS process, and switch to the ESS
     process buffer (ready to edit the copied command).  

   * `M-RET' (`ess-transcript-send-command-and-move')
     Send the current command to the ESS process, and move to the next
     command line.  This command is useful for submitting a series of
     commands.

Note that these commands are similar to those on the same keys in
Inferior S Mode.  In all three cases, the commands should be executed
when the cursor is on a command line in the transcript; the prompt is
automatically removed before the command is submitted.


File: ess.info,  Node: Clean,  Prev: Resubmit,  Up: Transcript Mode

5.2 Cleaning transcript files
=============================

Yet another use for transcript files is to extract the command lines for
inclusion in an S source file or function.  Transcript mode provides
one command which does just this:

   * `C-c C-w' (`ess-transcript-clean-region')
     Deletes all prompts and command output in the region, leaving only
     the commands themselves.

The remaining command lines may then be copied to a source file or edit
buffer for inclusion in a function definition, or may be evaluated
directly (*note Evaluating code::) using the code evaluation commands
from S mode, also available in S Transcript Mode.

6.1 ESS[S]-Editing files
========================

ESS[S] is the mode for editing S language files.  This mode handles:

   -  proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].

   -  color and font choices based on syntax.

   -  ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted
     region, an S function, or a single line to an inferior S process,
     if   one is currently running.

   -  ability to switch between processes which would be the target of
     the   buffer (for the above).

   -  The ability to request help from an S process for variables and
     functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.

   -  completion of object names and file names.

   ESS[S] mode should be automatically turned on when loading a file
with the suffices found in ess-site (*.R, *.S, *.s, etc).
Alternatively, type `M-x R-mode' to put the current buffer into R mode.
However, one will have to start up an inferior process to take
advantage of the interactive features.

6.2 iESS[S]-Inferior ESS processes
==================================

iESS (inferior ESS) is the mode for interfacing with active statistical
processes (programs).  This mode handles:

   -  proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].

   -  color and font highlighting based on syntax.

   -  ability to resubmit the contents of a multi-line command  to the
     executing process with a single keystroke [RET].

   -  The ability to request help from the current process for variables
     and functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.

   -  completion of object names and file names.

   -  interactive history mechanism.

   -  transcript recording and editing.

   To start up iESS mode, use:
        M-x S+3
        M-x S4
        M-x S+5
        M-x S+6
        M-x R

   (for S-PLUS 3.x, S4, S+5, S+6 or S+7, and R, respectively.  This
assumes that you have access to each).  Usually the site will have
defined one of these programs (by default S+6) to the simpler name:

   M-x S

   In the (rare) case that you wish to pass command line arguments to
the starting S+6 process, set the variable `inferior-Splus-args'.

   Note that R has some extremely useful command line arguments.  For
example, `--vanilla' will ensure R starts up without loading in any init
files.  To enter a command line argument, call R using a "prefix
argument", by

   C-u M-x R

   and when ESS prompts for "Starting Args ? ", enter (for example):

   `--vanilla'

   Then that R process will be started up using `R --vanilla'.  If you
wish to always call R with certain arguments, set the variable
`inferior-R-args' accordingly.

   If you have other versions of R or S-Plus available on the system,
ESS is also able to start those versions.  How this exactly works
depend on which OS you are using, as described in the following
paragraphs.  The general principle, regardless of OS, is that ESS
searches the paths listed in the variable `exec-path' for R binaries.
If ESS cannot find your R binaries, on Unix you can change the unix
environment variable `PATH', as this variable is used to set
`exec-path'.

   R on Unix systems: If you have "R-1.8.1" on your `exec-path', it can
be started using `M-x R-1.8.1'.  By default, ESS will find versions of
R beginning "R-1" or "R-2".  If your versions of R are called other
names, consider renaming them with a symbolic link or change the
variable `ess-r-versions'.  To see which functions have been created
for starting different versions of R, type `M-x R-' and then hit [Tab].
These other versions of R can also be started from the "ESS->Start
Process->Other" menu.

   R on Windows systems: If you have "rw1081" on your `exec-path', it
can be started using `M-x rw1081'.  By default, ESS will find versions
of R located in directories parallel to the version of R in your
`PATH'.  If your versions of R are called other names, you will need to
change the variable `ess-rterm-versions'.  To see which functions have
been created for starting different versions of R, type `M-x rw' and
then hit [Tab].  These other versions of R can also be started from the
"ESS->Start Process->Other" menu.

   Once ESS has found these extra versions of R, it will then create a
new function, called `M-x R-newest', which will call the newest version
of R that it found.  (ESS examines the date in the first line of
information from `R --version' to determine which is newest.)

   S on Unix systems: If you have "Splus7" on your `exec-path', it can
be started using `M-x Splus7'.  By default, ESS will find all
executables beginning "Splus" on your path.  If your versions of S are
called other names, consider renaming them with a symbolic link or
change the variable `ess-s-versions'.  To see which functions have been
created for starting different versions of Splus, type `M-x Splus' and
then hit [Tab].  These other versions of Splus can also be started from
the "ESS->Start Process->Other" menu.

   A second mechanim is also available for running other versions of
Splus.  The variable `ess-s-versions-list' is a list of lists; each
sublist should be of the form: (DEFUN-NAME PATH ARGS).  DEFUN-NAME is
the name of the new emacs function you wish to create to start the new
S process; PATH is the full path to the version of S you want to run;
ARGS is an optional string of command-line arguments to pass to the S
process.  Here is an example setting:
     (setq ess-s-versions-list
           '( ("Splus64" "/usr/local/bin/Splus64")
              ("Splus64-j" "/usr/local/bin/Splus64" "-j")))
   which will then allow you to do `M-x Splus64-j' to start  Splus64
with the corresponding command line arguments.

   If you change the value of either `ess-s-versions' or
`ess-s-versions-list', you should put them in your .emacs before
ess-site is loaded, since the new emacs functions are created when ESS
is loaded.

   Sqpe (S-Plus running inside an emacs buffer) on Windows systems: If
you have an older version of S-Plus (S-Plus 6.1 for example) on your
system, ir can be started inside an emacs buffer with `M-x splus61'.  By
default, ESS will find versions of S-Plus located in the installation
directories that Insightful uses by default.  If your versions of S-Plus
are anywhere else, you will need to change the variable
`ess-SHOME-versions'.  To see which functions have been created for
starting different versions of S-Plus, type `M-x spl' and then hit
[Tab].  These other versions of S-Plus can also be started from the
"ESS->Start Process->Other" menu.

6.4 Philosophies for using ESS[S]
=================================

The first is preferred, and configured for.  The second one can be
retrieved again, by changing emacs variables.

   1: (preferred by the current group of developers):  The source code
is    real.  The objects are realizations of the source code.  Source
for EVERY user modified object is placed in a particular directory
or directories, for later editing and retrieval.

   2: (older version): S objects are real.  Source code is a temporary
 realization of the objects.  Dumped buffers should not be saved.
_We_strongly_discourage_this_approach_.  However, if you insist,    add
the following lines to your .emacs file:
     (setq ess-keep-dump-files 'nil)
     (setq ess-delete-dump-files t)
     (setq ess-mode-silently-save nil)
   The second saves a small amount of disk space.  The first allows for
better portability as well as external version control for code.

6.5 Scenarios for use (possibilities-based on actual usage)
===========================================================

We present some basic suggestions for using ESS to interact with S.
These are just a subset of approaches, many better approaches are
possible.  Contributions of examples of how you work with ESS are
appreciated (especially since it helps us determine priorities on
future enhancements)! (comments as to what should be happening are
prefixed by "##").
     1:  ##    Data Analysis Example (source code is real)
         ## Load the file you want to work with
         C-x C-f myfile.s

         ## Edit as appropriate, and then start up S-PLUS 3.x
         M-x S+3

         ## A new buffer *S+3:1* will appear.  Splus will have been started
         ## in this buffer.  The buffer is in iESS [S+3:1] mode.

         ## Split the screen and go back to the file editing buffer.
         C-x 2 C-x b myfile.s

         ## Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to S-PLUS.  For regions,
         ## highlight a region with keystrokes or mouse and then send with:
         C-c C-r

         ## Re-edit myfile.s as necessary to correct any difficulties.  Add
         ## new commands here.  Send them to S by region with C-c C-r, or
         ## one line at a time with C-c C-n.

         ## Save the revised myfile.s with C-x C-s.

         ## Save the entire *S+3:1* interaction buffer with C-c C-s.  You
         ## will be prompted for a file name.  The recommended name is
         ## myfile.St.  With the *.St suffix, the file will come up in ESS
         ## Transcript mode the next time it is accessed from Emacs.



     2:  ## Program revision example (source code is real)

         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Load the file you want to work with
         C-x C-f myfile.s

         ## edit program, functions, and code in myfile.s, and send revised
         ## functions to S when ready with
         C-c C-f
         ## or highlighted regions with
         C-c C-r
         ## or individual lines with
         C-c C-n
         ## or load the entire buffer with
         C-c C-l

         ## save the revised myfile.s when you have finished
         C-c C-s



     3:  ## Program revision example (S object is real)

         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Dump an existing S object my.function into a buffer to work with
         C-c C-d my.function
         ## a new buffer named yourloginname.my.function.S will be created with
         ## an editable copy of the object.  The buffer is associated with the
         ## pathname /tmp/yourloginname.my.function.S and will amlost certainly not
         ## exist after you log off.

         ## enter program, functions, and code into work buffer, and send
         ## entire contents to S-PLUS when ready
         C-c C-b

         ## Go to *S+3:1* buffer, which is the process buffer, and examine
         ## the results.
         C-c C-y
         ## The sequence C-c C-y is a shortcut for:  C-x b *S+3:1*

         ## Return to the work buffer (may/may not be prefixed)
         C-x C-b yourloginname.my.function.S
         ## Fix the function that didn't work, and resubmit by placing the
         ## cursor somewhere in the function and
         C-c C-f
         ## Or you could've selected a region (using the mouse, or keyboard
         ## via setting point/mark) and
         C-c C-r
         ## Or you could step through, line by line, using
         C-c C-n
         ## Or just send a single line (without moving to the next) using
         C-c C-j
         ## To fix that error in syntax for the "rchisq" command, get help
         ## by
         C-c C-v rchisq


     4:    Data Analysis (S object is real)
         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x, in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Work in the process buffer.  When you find an object that needs
         ## to be changed (this could be a data frame, or a variable, or a
         ## function), dump it to a buffer:
         C-c C-d my.cool.function

         ## Edit the function as appropriate, and dump back in to the
         ## process buffer
         C-c C-b

         ## Return to the S-PLUS process buffer
         C-c C-y
         ## Continue working.

         ## When you need help, use
         C-c C-v rchisq
         ## instead of entering:   help("rchisq")

6.6 Customization Examples and Solutions to Problems
====================================================

1. Suppose that you are primarily an SPLUS 3.4 user, occasionally
using S version 4, and sick and tired of the buffer-name *S+3*    we've
stuck you with.  Simply edit the "ess-dialect" alist entry in    the
ess-sp3-d.el and ess-s4-d.el files to be "S" instead of "S4" and
"S+3".  This will ensure that all the inferior process buffer names
are "*S*".

   2. Suppose that you WANT to have the first buffer name indexed by
":1", in the same manner as your S-PLUS processes 2,3,4, and 5 (for
you heavy simulation people).  Then    add after your (require
'ess-site) or (load "ess-site") command     in your .emacs file, the
line:
     (setq ess-plain-first-buffername nil)

   3. Fontlocking sometimes fails to behave nicely upon errors.  When
Splus dumps, a mis-matched "  (double-quote) can result in the    wrong
font-lock face being used for the remainder of the buffer.

   Solution: add a " at the end of the "Dumped..." statement, to
revert the font-lock face back to normal.

   4. When you change directory within a *R* or *S* session using the
setwd() command, emacs does not recognise that you have changed the
current directory.

   Solution: Use `M-x ess-change-directory'.  This will prompt you for
the directory to change to.  It will then change directory within the
*S* buffer, and also update the emacs variable `default-directory'.
Alternatively, if you have already executed setwd(), press `M-RET'
within the *S* buffer so that Emacs can update `default-directory'.

7 Editing S functions
*********************

ESS provides facilities for editing S objects within your Emacs
session.  Most editing is performed on S functions, although in theory
you may edit datasets as well.  Edit buffers are always associated with
files, although you may choose to make these files temporary if you
wish.  Alternatively, you may make use of a simple yet powerful
mechanism for maintaining backups of text representations of S
functions.  Error-checking is performed when S code is loaded into the
ESS process.

* Menu:

* Edit buffer::                 Edit objects in a specialized buffer
* Loading::                     Loading source files into the ESS process
* Error Checking::              Detecting errors in source files
* Evaluating code::             Sending code to the ESS process
* Indenting::                   Indenting and formatting S code
* Other edit buffer commands::  Commands for motion, completion and more
* Source Files::                Maintaining S source files
* Source Directories::          Names and locations of dump files


File: ess.info,  Node: Edit buffer,  Next: Loading,  Prev: Editing,  Up: Editing

7.1 Creating or modifying S objects
===================================

To edit an S object, type

   * `C-c C-d' (`ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer')
     Edit an S object in its own edit buffer.

   from within the ESS process buffer (`*S*').  You will then be
prompted for an object to edit: you may either type in the name of an
existing object (for which completion is available using the `TAB' key), or
you may enter the name of a new object.  A buffer will be created
containing the text representation of the requested object or, if you
entered the name of a non-existent object at the prompt and the
variable `ess-function-template' is non-`nil', you will be presented
with a template defined by that variable, which defaults to a skeleton
function construct.

   You may then edit the function as required.  The edit buffer
generated by `ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' is placed in the `ESS'
major mode which provides a number of commands to facilitate editing S
source code.  Commands are provided to intelligently indent S code,
evaluate portions of S code and to move around S code constructs.

   Note: when you dump a file with `C-c C-d', ESS first checks to see
whether there already exists an edit buffer containing that object and,
if so, pops you directly to that buffer.  If not, ESS next checks
whether there is a file in the appropriate place with the appropriate
name (*note Source Files::) and if so, reads in that file.  You can use
this facility to return to an object you were editing in a previous
session (and which possibly was never loaded to the S session).
Finally, if both these tests fail, the ESS process is consulted and a
`dump()' command issued.  If you want to force ESS to ask the ESS
process for the object's definition (say, to reformat an unmodified
buffer or to revert back to S's idea of the object's definition) pass a
prefix argument to `ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' by typing `C-u
C-c C-d'.


File: ess.info,  Node: Loading,  Next: Error Checking,  Prev: Edit buffer,  Up: Editing

7.2 Loading source files into the ESS process
=============================================

The best way to get information -- particularly function definitions --
into S is to load them in as source file, using S's `source' function.
You have already seen how to create source files using `C-c C-d'; ESS
provides a complementary command for loading source files (even files
not created with ESS!) into the ESS process:

   * `C-c C-l' (`ess-load-file')
     Loads a file into the ESS process using `source()'.  

After typing `C-c C-l' you will prompted for the name of the file to
load into S; usually this is the current buffer's file which is the
default value (selected by simply pressing `RET' at the prompt).  You
will be asked to save the buffer first if it has been modified (this
happens automatically if the buffer was generated with `C-c C-d').  The
file will then be loaded, and if it loads successfully you will be
returned to the ESS process.


File: ess.info,  Node: Error Checking,  Next: Evaluating code,  Prev: Loading,  Up: Editing

7.3 Detecting errors in source files
====================================

If any errors occur when loading a file with `C-c C-l', ESS will inform
you of this fact.  In this case, you can jump directly to the line in
the source file which caused the error by typing `C-c `'
(`ess-parse-errors').  You will be returned to the offending file
(loading it into a buffer if necessary) with point at the line S
reported as containing the error.  You may then correct the error, and
reload the file.  Note that none of the commands in an S source file
will take effect if any part of the file contains errors.

   Sometimes the error is not caused by a syntax error (loading a
non-existent file for example). In this case typing `C-c `' will simply
display a buffer containing S's error message.  You can force this
behavior (and avoid jumping to the file when there _is_ a syntax error)
by passing a prefix argument to `ess-parse-errors' with `C-u C-c `'.


File: ess.info,  Node: Evaluating code,  Next: Indenting,  Prev: Error Checking,  Up: Editing

7.4 Sending code to the ESS process
===================================

Other commands are also available for evaluating portions of code in the
S process.  These commands cause the selected code to be evaluated
directly by the ESS process as if you had typed them in at the command
line; the `source()' function is not used.  You may choose whether both
the commands and their output appear in the process buffer (as if you
had typed in the commands yourself) or if the output alone is echoed.
The behavior is controlled by the variable `ess-eval-visibly-p' whose
default is `nil' (display output only).  Passing a prefix argument
(`C-u') to any of the following commands, however, reverses the meaning
of `ess-eval-visibly-p' for that command only -- for example `C-u C-c
C-j' echoes the current line of S (or other) code in the ESS process
buffer, followed by its output.  This method of evaluation is an
alternative to S's `source()' function when you want the input as well
as the output to be displayed.  (You can sort of do this with
`source()' when the option `echo=T' is set, except that prompts do not
get displayed.  ESS puts prompts in the right places.) The commands for
evaluating code are:

   * `C-c C-j' (`ess-eval-line')
     Send the line containing point to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-j' (`ess-eval-line-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-f' or `ESC C-x' (aka `M-C-x') (`ess-eval-function')
     Send the S function containing point to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-f' (`ess-eval-function-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-r' (`ess-eval-region')
     Send the text between point and mark to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-r' (`ess-eval-region-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-b' (`ess-eval-buffer')
     Send the contents of the edit buffer to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-b' (`ess-eval-buffer-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-n' (`ess-eval-line-and-step')
     Sends the current line to the ESS process, echoing it in the
     process buffer, and moves point to the next line.  Useful when
     debugging for stepping through your code.

   It should be stressed once again that these `ess-eval-' commands
should only be used for evaluating small portions of code for debugging
purposes, or for generating transcripts from source files.  When editing
S functions, `C-c C-l' is the command to use to update the function's
value.  In particular, `ess-eval-buffer' is now largely obsolete.

   One final command is provided for spot-evaluations of S code:

     `C-c C-t' (`ess-execute-in-tb')
     Prompt for an S expression and evaluate it.  Displays result in a
     temporary buffer.

This is useful for quick calculations, etc.

   All the above commands are useful for evaluating small amounts of
code and observing the results in the process buffer.  A useful way to
work is to divide the frame into two windows; one containing the source
code and the other containing the process buffer.  If you wish to make
the process buffer scroll automatically when the output reaches the
bottom of the window, you will need to set the variable
`comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output' to `'others' or `t'.


File: ess.info,  Node: Indenting,  Next: Other edit buffer commands,  Prev: Evaluating code,  Up: Editing

7.5 Indenting and formatting S code
===================================

ESS provides a sophisticated mechanism for indenting S source code
(thanks to Ken'ichi Shibayama).  Compound statements (delimited by `{'
and `}') are indented relative to their enclosing block.  In addition,
the braces have been electrified to automatically indent to the correct
position when inserted, and optionally insert a newline at the
appropriate place as well.  Lines which continue an incomplete
expression are indented relative to the first line of the expression.
Function definitions, `if' statements, calls to `expression()' and loop
constructs are all recognized and indented appropriately.  User
variables are provided to control the amount if indentation in each
case, and there are also a number of predefined indentation styles to
choose from.

   Comments are also handled specially by ESS, using an idea borrowed
from the Emacs-Lisp indentation style.  By default, comments beginning
with `###' are aligned to the beginning of the line.  Comments
beginning with `##' are aligned to the current level of indentation for
the block containing the comment.  Finally, comments beginning with `#'
are aligned to a column on the right (the 40th column by default, but
this value is controlled by the variable `comment-column',) or just
after the expression on the line containing the comment if it extends
beyond the indentation column.  You turn off the default behavior by
adding the line `(setq ess-fancy-comments nil)' to your `.emacs' file.  

   ESS also supports Roxygen entries which is R documentation
maintained in the source code as comments *Note Roxygen::.

   The indentation commands provided by ESS are: 

   * `TAB' (`ess-indent-command')
     Indents the current line as S code.  If a prefix argument is given,
     all following lines which are part of the same (compound)
     expression are indented by the same amount (but relative indents
     are preserved).

   * `RET' (`newline-and-indent')
     `LFD' (_newline-and-indent_)
     Insert a newline, and indent the next line.  (Note that most
     keyboards nowadays do not have a <LINEFEED> key, but `C-j' is
     equivalent.)

   * `ESC C-q' aka `M-C-q' aka `C-M-q' (`ess-indent-exp')
     Indents each line in the S (compound) expression which follows
     point.  Very useful for beautifying your S code.

   * `{' and `}' (`ess-electric-brace')
     The braces automatically indent to the correct position when typed.

   * `M-;' (`indent-for-comment')
     Indents an existing comment line appropriately, or inserts an
     appropriate comment marker.

   * `M-x ess-set-style'
     Set the formatting style in this buffer to be one of the predefined
     styles, including `GNU', `BSD', `K&R', `CLB', and `C++'. The
     `DEFAULT' style uses the default values for the indenting
     variables;  The `OWN' style allows you to use your own private
     values of the indentation variable, see below.

* Menu:

* Styles::                     Changing indentation styles


File: ess.info,  Node: Styles,  Prev: Indenting,  Up: Indenting

7.5.1 Changing indentation styles
---------------------------------

The combined value of nine variables that control indentation are
collectively termed a style.  ESS provides several styles covering the
common styles of indentation: `DEFAULT', `OWN', `GNU', `BSD', `K&R',
`C++', `RRR', `CLB'.  The variable `ess-style-alist' lists the value of
each indentation variable per style.

   If you wish to change from one predefined style to another, change
the variable `ess-default-style', for example:

     (setq ess-default-style 'C++)

   The styles `DEFAULT' and `OWN' are initially identical.  If you wish
to edit some of the default values, set `ess-default-style' to `'OWN'
and change `ess-own-style-list'.  *Note Customization::, for convenient
ways to set both these variables.

   If you prefer not to use the custom facility, you can change
individual indentation variables within a hook, for example:

     (defun myindent-ess-hook ()
       (setq ess-indent-level 4))
     (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'myindent-ess-hook)

   In the rare case that you'd like to add an entire new indentation
style of your own, copy the definition of `ess-own-style-list' to a new
variable and ensure that the last line of the `:set' declaration calls
`ess-add-style' with a unique name for your style (e.g. `'MINE').
Finally, add `(setq ess-default-style 'MINE)' to use your new style.


File: ess.info,  Node: Other edit buffer commands,  Next: Source Files,  Prev: Indenting,  Up: Editing

7.6 Commands for motion, completion and more
============================================

A number of commands are provided to move across function definitions
in the edit buffer:
   * `ESC C-a' aka `C-M-a' (`ess-beginning-of-function')
     Moves point to the beginning of the function containing point.

   * `ESC C-e' aka `C-M-e' (`ess-end-of-function')
     Moves point to the end of the function containing point.

   * `ESC C-h' aka `C-M-h' (`ess-mark-function')
     Places point at the beginning of the S function containing point,
     and mark at the end.
   Don't forget the usual Emacs commands for moving over balanced
expressions and parentheses: *Note Lists and Sexps: (Emacs)Lists.

   Completion is provided in the edit buffer in a similar fashion to the
process buffer: `M-TAB' completes file names and `M-?' lists file
completions.  Since <TAB> is used for indentation in the edit buffer,
object completion is now performed with `C-c TAB'.  Note however that
completion is only provided over globally known S objects (such as
system functions) -- it will _not_ work for arguments to functions or
other variables local to the function you are editing.

   Finally, two commands are provided for returning to the ESS process
buffer:

   * `C-c C-z' (`ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS')
     Returns you to the ESS process buffer, placing point at the end of
     the buffer.

   * `C-c C-y' (`ess-switch-to-ESS')
     Also returns to to the ESS process buffer, but leaves point where
     it was.

   In addition some commands available in the process buffer are also
available in the edit buffer.  You can still read help files with `C-c
C-v', edit another function with `C-c C-d' and of course `C-c C-l' can
be used to load a source file into S.  *Note Other::, for more details
on these commands.

7.7 Maintaining S source files
==============================

Every edit buffer in ESS is associated with a "dump file" on disk.
Dump files are created whenever you type `C-c C-d'
(`ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer'), and may either be deleted after
use, or kept as a backup file or as a means of keeping several versions
of an S function.  

 -- User Option: ess-delete-dump-files
     If non-`nil', dump files created with C-c C-d are deleted
     immediately after they are created by the ess-process.

   Since immediately after S dumps an object's definition to a disk
file the source code on disk corresponds exactly to S's idea of the
object's definition, the disk file isn't needed; deleting it now has the
advantage that if you _don't_ modify the file (say, because you just
wanted to look at the definition of one of the standard S functions)
the source dump file won't be left around when you kill the buffer.
Note that this variable only applies to files generated with S's `dump'
function; it doesn't apply to source files which already exist.  The
default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: ess-keep-dump-files
     Option controlling what to do with the dump file after an object
     has been successfully loaded into S.  Valid values are `nil'
     (always delete), `ask' (always ask whether to delete), `check'
     (delete files generated with `C-c C-d' in this Emacs session,
     otherwise ask -- this is the default) and `t' (never delete).
     This variable is buffer-local.

   After an object has been successfully (i.e. without error) loaded
back into S with `C-c C-l', the disk file again corresponds exactly
(well, almost -- see below) to S's record of the object's definition,
and so some people prefer to delete the disk file rather than
unnecessarily use up space.  This option allows you to do just that.

   If the value of `ess-keep-dump-files' is `t', dump files are never
deleted after they are loaded.  Thus you can maintain a complete text
record of the functions you have edited within ESS.  Backup files are
kept as usual, and so by using the Emacs numbered backup facility --
*note Single or Numbered Backups: (emacs)Backup Names, you can keep a
historic record of function definitions.  Another possibility is to
maintain the files with a version-control system such as RCS *Note
Version Control: (emacs)Version Control.  As long as a dump file exists
in the appropriate place for a particular object, editing that object
with `C-c C-d' finds that file for editing (unless a prefix argument is
given) -- the ESS process is not consulted.  Thus you can keep comments
_outside_ the function definition as a means of documentation that does
not clutter the S object itself.  Another useful feature is that you
may format the code in any fashion you please without S re-indenting
the code every time you edit it.  These features are particularly
useful for project-based work.

   If the value of `ess-keep-dump-files' is nil, the dump file is always
silently deleted after a successful load with `C-c C-l'.  While this is
useful for files that were created with `C-c C-d' it also applies to
any other file you load (say, a source file of function definitions),
and so can be dangerous to use unless you are careful.  Note that since
`ess-keep-dump-files' is buffer-local, you can make sure particular
files are not deleted by setting it to `t' in the Local Variables
section of the file *Note Local Variables in Files: (emacs)File
Variables.

   A safer option is to set `ess-keep-dump-files' to `ask'; this means
that ESS will always ask for confirmation before deleting the file.
Since this can get annoying if you always want to delete dump files
created with `C-c C-d', but not any other files, setting
`ess-keep-dump-files' to `check' (the default value) will silently
delete dump files created with `C-c C-d' in the current Emacs session,
but query for any other file.  Note that in any case you will only be
asked for confirmation once per file, and your answer is remembered for
the rest of the Emacs session.

   Note that in all cases, if an error (such as a syntax error) is
detected while loading the file with `C-c C-l', the dump file is _never_
deleted.  This is so that you can edit the file in a new Emacs session
if you happen to quit Emacs before correcting the error.

   Dump buffers are always autosaved, regardless of the value of
`ess-keep-dump-files'.

7.8 Names and locations of dump files
=====================================

Every dump file should be given a unique file name, usually the dumped
object name with some additions.

 -- User Option: ess-dump-filename-template
     Template for filenames of dumped objects.  `%s' is replaced by the
     object name.

By default, dump file names are the user name, followed by `.' and the
object and ending with `.S'.  Thus if user `joe' dumps the object
`myfun' the dump file will have name `joe.myfun.S'.  The username part
is included to avoid clashes when dumping into a publicly-writable
directory, such as `/tmp'; you may wish to remove this part if you are
dumping into a directory owned by you.

   You may also specify the directory in which dump files are written:

 -- User Option: ess-source-directory
     Directory name (ending in a slash) where S dump files are to be
     written.

   By default, dump files are always written to `/tmp', which is fine
when `ess-keep-dump-files' is `nil'.  If you are keeping dump files,
then you will probably want to keep them somewhere in your home
directory, say `~/S-source'.  This could be achieved by including the
following line in your `.emacs' file: 
     (setq ess-source-directory (expand-file-name "~/S-source/"))

   If you would prefer to keep your dump files in separate directories
depending on the value of some variable, ESS provides a facility for
this also.  By setting `ess-source-directory' to a lambda expression
which evaluates to a directory name, you have a great deal of
flexibility in selecting the directory for a particular source file to
appear in.  The lambda expression is evaluated with the process buffer
as the current buffer and so you can use the variables local to that
buffer to make your choice.  For example, the following expression
causes source files to be saved in the subdirectory `Src' of the
directory the ESS process was run in.

     (setq ess-source-directory
           (lambda ()
              (concat ess-directory "Src/")))

(`ess-directory' is a buffer-local variable in process buffers which
records the directory the ESS process was run from.)  This is useful if
you keep your dump files and you often edit objects with the same name
in different ESS processes.  Alternatively, if you often change your S
working directory during an S session, you may like to keep dump files
in some subdirectory of the directory pointed to by the first element
of the current search list.  This way you can edit objects of the same
name in different directories during the one S session: 
     (setq ess-source-directory
        (lambda ()
            (file-name-as-directory
             (expand-file-name (concat
                                (car ess-search-list)
                                "/.Src")))))
   
   If the directory generated by the lambda function does not exist but
can be created, you will be asked whether you wish to create the
directory.  If you choose not to, or the directory cannot be created,
you will not be able to edit functions.

8 Editing R documentation
*************************

ESS provides two ways of writing documentation for R objects. Either
using the standard R documentation system or using in-source
documentation written as structured comment fields for use with the
Roxygen package.

* Menu:

* R documentation files::       Edit objects in a specialized buffer
* Roxygen::                     Loading source files into the ESS process


File: ess.info,  Node: R documentation files,  Next: Roxygen,  Prev: Editing R documentation,  Up: Editing R documentation

8.1 Editing R documentation (Rd) files
======================================

R objects are documented in files written in the "R documentation"
("Rd"), a simple markup language closely resembling (La)TeX, which can
be processed into a variety of formats, including LaTeX, HTML, and
plain text.  Rd format is described in section "Rd format" of the
"Writing R Extensions" manual in the R distribution. ESS has several
features that facilitate editing Rd files.

   Visiting an Rd file as characterized by its extension `Rd' will
activate Rd Mode, which provides several facilities for making editing R
documentation files more convenient, by helping with indentation,
insertions, even doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev Mode),
and by showing Rd keywords, strings, etc. in different faces (with Font
Lock Mode).

   Note that R also accepts Rd files with extension `rd'; to activate
ESS[Rd] support for this extension, you may need to add

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rd\\'" . Rd-mode))

to one of your Emacs startup files.

   In Rd mode, the following special Emacs commands can be used in
addition to the standard Emacs commands.

`C-h m'
     Describe the features of Rd mode.

`LFD'
`RET'
     Reindent the current line, insert a newline and indent the new line
     (`reindent-then-newline-and-indent').  An abbrev before point is
     expanded if `abbrev-mode' is non-`nil'.

`TAB'
     Indent current line based on its contents and on previous lines
     (`indent-according-to-mode').

`C-c C-e'
     Insert a "skeleton" with Rd markup for at least all mandatory
     entries in Rd files (`Rd-mode-insert-skeleton').  Note that many
     users might prefer to use the R function `prompt' on an existing R
     object to generate a non-empty Rd "shell" documenting the object
     (which already has all information filled in which can be obtained
     from the object).

`C-c C-f'
     Insert "font" specifiers for some of the Rd markup commands markup
     available for emphasizing or quoting text, including markup for
     URLs and email addresses (`Rd-font').  `C-c C-f' is only a prefix;
     see e.g. `C-c C-f TAB' for the available bindings.  Note that
     currently, not all of the Rd text markup as described in section
     "Marking text" of "Writing R Extensions" can be accessed via `C-c
     C-f'.

`C-c C-j'
     Insert a suitably indented  `\item{' on the next line
     (`Rd-mode-insert-item').

`C-c C-p'
     Preview a plain text version ("help file", *note Help::) generated
     from the Rd file (`Rd-preview-help').

   In addition, when editing Rd files one can interact with a running R
process in a similar way as when editing R language files.  E.g., `C-c
C-v' provides access to on-line help, and `C-c C-n' sends the current
line to the R process for evaluation.  This interaction is particularly
useful when editing the examples in the Rd file.  See `C-h m' for all
available commands.

   Rd mode also provides access to abbreviations for most of the Rd
markup commands.  Type `M-x list-abbrevs' with Abbrev mode turned on to
list all available abbrevs.  Note that all Rd abbrevs start with a grave
accent.

   Rd mode can be customized via the following variables.

`Rd-mode-hook'
     Hook to be run when Rd mode is entered.

`Rd-indent-level'
     The indentation of Rd code with respect to containing blocks.
     Default is 2.

`Rd-to-help-command'
     The shell command used for converting Rd source to help text.
     Default is `R CMD Rd2txt'.

   To automatically turn on the abbrev and font-lock features of Rd
mode, add the following lines to one of your Emacs startup files:

     (add-hook 'Rd-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (abbrev-mode 1)
                (font-lock-mode 1)))


File: ess.info,  Node: Roxygen,  Prev: R documentation files,  Up: Editing R documentation

8.2 Editing Roxygen documentation
=================================

The Roxygen R package makes it possible to keep the intended contents
for Rd files as structured comments in the R source files. Roxygen can
then parse R files and generate appropriate Rd files from these
comments, fill the usage fields as well as updating `NAMESPACE' files.
See the Roxygen documentation found via `http://roxygen.org' for more
information its usage. An example of an Roxygen entry for a simple R
function can look like this:

     ##' Description of the function
     ##'
     ##' Further details about this function
     ##' @title A title
     ##' @param me all parameters must be listed and documented
     ##' @return Description of the return value
     ##' @author The author
     myfun <- function(me)
       cat("Hello", me, "\n")
   The entry is immediately preceding the object to document and all
lines start with the Roxygen prefix string, in this case `##''. ESS
provides support to edit these documentation entries by providing line
filling, navigation, template generation etc. Syntax highlighting is
provided for Emacs but not for XEmacs.

   Roxygen is customized by the variables in the customization group
"Ess Roxy". Customizables include the Roxygen prefix, use of folding to
toggle visibility of Roxygen entries and the Roxygen template.

   All ESS Roxygen support is defined in `ess-roxy.el' which is loaded
by default in ESS. The following special Emacs commands are provided.

   * `C-c C-o' (`ess-roxy-update-entry')
     Generate a Roxygen template or update the parameter list in Roxygen
     entry at point (or above the function at the point). Documented
     parameters that are not in the function are placed last in the
     list, parameters that are not documented and not in the definition
     are dropped. Parameter descriptions are filled if
     `ess-roxy-fill-param-p' is non-nil.

   * `C-c C-e C-c' (`ess-roxy-toggle-roxy-region')
     Toggle the presence of the leading Roxygen string on all lines in
     the marked region. Convenient for transferring text to Roxygen
     entries and to evaluate example fields.

   * `C-c C-e C-r' (`ess-roxy-preview-Rd')
     Use the attached R process to parse the entry at point to obtain
     the Rd code. Convenient for previewing and checking syntax. When
     used with the prefix argument, i.e. `C-u C-c C-e C-r', place the
     content in a buffer associated with a Rd file with the same name
     as the documentation. Requires the Roxygen package to be installed.

   * `C-c C-e C-t' (`ess-roxy-preview-HTML')
     Use the attached R process to parse the entry at to generate HTML
     for the entry and open it in a browser. When used with the prefix
     argument, i.e. `C-u C-c C-e C-t', visit the generated HTML file
     instead.  Requires the Roxygen and tools packages to be installed.

   * `C-c C-e p' (`ess-roxy-previous-entry')
     Go to start of the Roxygen entry above point.

   * `C-c C-e n'  (`ess-roxy-next-entry')
     Go to end of the Roxygen entry above point.

   * `C-c C-e C-h' (`ess-roxy-hide-all')
     Use the hideshow mode to fold away the visibility of all Roxygen
     entries. Hide-show support must be enabled for this binding to get
     defined.

     ESS also advices the following standard editing functions in order
     to make Roxygen editing more intuitive:

   * `C-c TAB' (`ess-R-complete-object-name')
     Complete Roxygen tag at point. E.g. doing `C-c TAB' when the point
     is at the end of `@par' completes to `@param'.

   * `M-h' (`mark-paragraph')
     If the transient mark mode is active, place mark and point at
     start end end of the field at point and activate the mark.

   * `TAB' (`ess-indent-command')
     If hide-show support is enabled, fold away the visibility of the
     Roxygen entry at point.

   * `M-q' (`fill-paragraph')
     Fill the Roxygen field at point.

   * `C-a' (`move-beginning-of-line')
     Move to the point directly to the right of the Roxygen start
     string.

   * `ENTER' (`newline-and-indent')
     Insert a new line and the Roxygen prefix string.

9 Reading help files
********************

ESS provides an easy-to-use facility for reading S help files from
within Emacs.  From within the ESS process buffer or any ESS edit
buffer, typing `C-c C-v' (`ess-display-help-on-object') will prompt you
for the name of an object for which you would like documentation.
Completion is provided over all objects which have help files.

   If the requested object has documentation, you will be popped into a
buffer (named `*help(OBJ-NAME)*') containing the help file.  This
buffer is placed in a special `S Help' mode which disables the usual
editing commands but which provides a number of keys for paging through
the help file:

     Help commands:

   * `?' (`ess-describe-help-mode')
     Pops up a help buffer with a list of the commands available in S
     help mode.

   * `h' (`ess-display-help-on-object')
     Pop up a help buffer for a different object

     Paging commands:

   * `b' or `DEL' (`scroll-down')
     Move one page backwards through the help file.

   * `SPC' (`scroll-up')
     Move one page forwards through the help file.

   * `>' (`beginning-of-buffer') and `<' (`end-of-buffer')
     Move to the beginning and end of the help file, respectively.

     Section-based motion commands:

   * `n' (`ess-skip-to-next-section') and `p'
     (`ess-skip-to-previous-section')
     Move to the next and previous section header in the help file,
     respectively.  A section header consists of a number of
     capitalized words, followed by a colon.

     In addition, the `s' key followed by one of the following letters
     will jump to a particular section in the help file.  Note that R
     uses capitalized instead of all-capital section headers, e.g.,
     `Description:' instead of  `DESCRIPTION:' and also only some
     versions of S(-plus) have sections `BACKGROUND', `BUGS', `OPTIONAL
     ARGUMENTS', `REQUIRED ARGUMENTS', and `SIDE EFFECTS'.

     Do use `s ?' to get the current list of active key bindings.  
    `a'
          ARGUMENTS:

    `b'
          BACKGROUND:

    `B'
          BUGS:

    `d'
          DESCRIPTION:

    `D'
          DETAILS:

    `e'
          EXAMPLES:

    `n'
          NOTE:

    `O'
          OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:

    `R'
          REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:

    `r'
          REFERENCES:

    `s'
          SEE ALSO:

    `S'
          SIDE EFFECTS:

    `u'
          USAGE:

    `v'
          VALUE:

    `<'
          Jumps to beginning of file

    `>'
          Jumps to end of file

    `?'
          Pops up a help buffer with a list of the defined section
          motion keys.

     Miscellaneous:

   * `l' (`ess-eval-line-and-step')
     Evaluates the current line in the ESS process, and moves to the
     next line.  Useful for running examples in help files.

   * `r' (`ess-eval-region')
     Send the contents of the current region to the ESS process.  Useful
     for running examples in help files.

   * `/' (`isearch-forward')
     Same as `C-s'.

     Quit commands:

   * `q' (`ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS')
     Returns to the ESS process buffer in another window, leaving the
     help window visible.

   * `k' (`kill-buffer')
     Kills the help buffer.

   * `x' (`ess-kill-buffer-and-go')
     Return to the ESS process, killing this help buffer.

   In addition, all of the ESS commands available in the edit buffers
are also available in S help mode (*note Edit buffer::).  Of course, the
usual (non-editing) Emacs commands are available, and for convenience
the digits and <-> act as prefix arguments.

   If a help buffer already exists for an object for which help is
requested, that buffer is popped to immediately; the ESS process is not
consulted at all.  If the contents of the help file have changed, you
either need to kill the help buffer first, or pass a prefix argument
(with `C-u') to `ess-display-help-on-object'.

   Help buffers are marked as temporary buffers in ESS, and are deleted
when `ess-quit' or `ess-cleanup' are called.

   Help buffers normally appear in another window within the current
frame.  If you wish help buffers to appear in their own frame (either
one per help buffer, or one for all help buffers), you can customize the
variable `ess-help-own-frame'.

   ESS[SAS] was designed for use with SAS.  It is descended from emacs
macros developed by John Sall for editing SAS programs and `SAS-mode' by
Tom Cook.  Those editing features and new advanced features are part of
ESS[SAS].  The user interface of ESS[SAS] has similarities with ESS[S]
and the SAS Display Manager.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--Design philosophy,  Next: ESS(SAS)--Editing files,  Prev: ESS for SAS,  Up: ESS for SAS

10.1 ESS(SAS)-Design philosophy
===============================

ESS[SAS] was designed to aid the user in writing and maintaining SAS
programs, such as `FOO.sas'.  Both interactive and batch submission of
SAS programs is supported.

   ESS[SAS] was written with two primary goals.
  1. The emacs text editor provides a powerful and flexible development
     environment for programming languages.  These features are a boon
     to all programmers and, with the help of ESS[SAS], to SAS users as
     well.

  2. Although a departure from SAS Display Manager, ESS[SAS] provides
     similar key definitions to give novice ESS[SAS] users a head start.
     Also, inconvenient SAS Display Manager features, like remote
     submission and syntax highlighting, are provided transparently;
     appealing to advanced ESS[SAS] users.

10.2 ESS(SAS)-Editing files
===========================

ESS[SAS] is the mode for editing SAS language files.  This mode handles:

   * proper indenting, generated by both <TAB> and <RET>.

   * color and font choices based on syntax.

   * ability to save and submit the file you are working on as a batch
     SAS process with a single keypress and to continue editing while
     it is runs in the background.

   * capability of killing the batch SAS process through the `*shell*'
     buffer or allow the SAS process to keep on running after you exit
     emacs.

   * single keypress navigation of `.sas', `.log' and `.lst' files
     (`.log' and `.lst' files are refreshed with each keypress).

   * ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted
     region, or a single line to an interactive SAS process.

   * ability to switch between processes which would be the target of
     the buffer (for the above).

   ESS[SAS] is automatically turned on when editing a file with a `.sas'
suffix (or other extension, if specified via `auto-mode-alist').  The
function keys can be enabled to use the same function keys that the SAS
Display Manager does.  The interactive capabilities of ESS require you
to start an inferior SAS process with `M-x SAS' (*Note
iESS(SAS)--Interactive SAS processes::.)

   At this writing, the indenting and syntax highlighting are generally
correct.  Known issues: for multiple line `*' or `%*' comments, only the
first line is highlighted; for `.log' files, only the first line of a
`NOTE:', `WARNING:' or `ERROR:' message is highlighted; unmatched
single/double quotes in `CARDS' data lines are *NOT* ignored; in an
iterative `DO' statement, `TO' and `BY' are not highlighted.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--TAB key,  Next: ESS(SAS)--Batch SAS processes,  Prev: ESS(SAS)--Editing files,  Up: ESS for SAS

10.3 ESS(SAS)-<TAB> key
=======================

Two options.  The <TAB> key is bound by default to `sas-indent-line'.
This function is used to syntactically indent SAS code so `PROC' and
`RUN' are in the left margin, other statements are indented
`sas-indent-width' spaces from the margin, continuation lines are
indented `sas-indent-width' spaces in from the beginning column of that
statement.  This is the type of functionality that emacs provides in
most programming language modes.  This functionality is activated by
placing the following line in your initialization file prior to a
`require'/`load':
     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle nil)

   ESS provides an alternate behavior for <TAB> that makes it behave as
it does in SAS Display Manager, i.e. move the cursor to the next stop.
The alternate behavior also provides a "TAB" backwards, `C-<TAB>', that
moves the cursor to the stop to the left and deletes any characters
between them.  This functionality is obtained by placing the following
line in your initialization file prior to a `require'/`load':
     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle t)
   Under the alternate behavior, <TAB> is bound to `M-x tab-to-tab-stop'
and the stops are defined by `ess-sas-tab-stop-list'.

10.4 ESS(SAS)-Batch SAS processes
=================================

Submission of a SAS batch job is dependent on your environment.
`ess-sas-submit-method' is determined by your operating system and your
shell.  It defaults to `'sh' unless you are running Windows or Mac
Classic.  Under Windows, it will default to `'sh' if you are using a
UNIX-imitating shell; otherwise `'ms-dos' for an MS-DOS shell.  On Mac
OS X, it will default to `'sh', but under Mac Classic, it defaults to
`'apple-script'.  You will also set this to `'sh' if the SAS batch job
needs to run on a remote machine rather than your local machine.  This
works transparently if you are editing the remote file via ange-ftp/EFS
or tramp.  Note that `ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init' is a Local
Variable that defaults to `"ssh"' which will be used to open the buffer
on the remote host and it is assumed that no password is necessary,
i.e. you are using `ssh-agent'/`ssh-add' or the equivalent (see the
discussion about Local Variables below if you need to change the
default).

   However, if you are editing the file locally and transferring it
back and forth with Kermit, you need some additional steps.  First,
start Kermit locally before remotely logging in.  Open a local copy of
the file with the `ess-kermit-prefix' character prepended (the default
is `"#"').  Execute the command `M-x ess-kermit-get' which
automatically brings the contents of the remote file into your local
copy.  If you transfer files with Kermit manually in a `*shell*'
buffer, then note that the Kermit escape sequence is `C-q C- c' rather
than `C- c' which it would be in an ordinary terminal application, i.e.
not in an emacs buffer.  Lastly, note that the remote Kermit command is
specified by `ess-kermit-command'.

   The command used by the `SUBMIT' function key (<F3> or <F8>) to
submit a batch SAS job, whether local or remote, is
`ess-sas-submit-command' which defaults to `sas-program'.
`sas-program' is `"invoke SAS using program file"' for Mac Classic and
`"sas"' otherwise.  However, you may have to alter
`ess-sas-submit-command' for a particular program, so it is defined as
buffer-local.  Conveniently, it can be set at the end of the program:
     endsas;
     Local variables:
     ess-sas-submit-command: "sas8"
     End:

   The command line is also made of `ess-sas-submit-pre-command',
`ess-sas-submit-post-command' and `ess-sas-submit-command-options' (the
last of which is also buffer-local).  Here are some examples for your
`~/.emacs' or `~/.xemacs/init.el' file (you may also use
`M-x customize-variable'):
     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "nohup")
     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser &")
     ;'sh example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "/usr/local/sas/sas")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "start")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser -icon")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:/progra~1/sas/sas.exe")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:\\progra~1\\sas\\sas.exe")

   There is a built-in delay before a batch SAS job is submitted when
using a UNIX-imitating shell under Windows.  This is necessary in many
cases since the shell might not be ready to receive a command.  This
delay is currently set high enough so as not to be a problem.  But,
there may be cases when it needs to be set higher, or could be set much
lower to speed things up.  You can over-ride the default in your
`~/.emacs' or `~/.xemacs/init.el' file by:
     (setq ess-sleep-for 0.2)

   For example, `(setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)' keys shown, `(setq
ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)' in parentheses; ESS[SAS] function keys are
presented in the next section.  Open the file you want to work with
`C-x C-f foo.sas'.  `FOO.sas' will be in ESS[SAS] mode.  Edit as
appropriate, then save and submit the batch SAS job.
     <F3> (<F8>)
   The job runs in the `*shell*' buffer while you continue to edit
`FOO.sas'.  If `ess-sas-submit-method' is `'sh', then the message
buffer will display the shell notification when the job is complete.
The `'sh' setting also allows you to terminate the SAS batch job before
it is finished.
     <F8> (<F3>)
   Terminating a SAS batch in the `*shell*' buffer.
     kill PID
   You may want to visit the `.log' (whether the job is still running
or it is finished) and check for error messages.  The `.log' will be
refreshed and you will be placed in it's buffer.  You will be taken to
the first error message, if any.
     <F5> (<F6>)
   Goto the next error message, if any.
     <F5> (<F6>)
   Now, `refresh' the `.lst' and go to it's buffer.
     <F6> (<F7>)
   If you wish to make changes, go to the `.sas' file with.
     <F4> (<F5>)
   Make your editing changes and submit again.

10.5 ESS(SAS)-Function keys for batch processing
================================================

The setup of function keys for SAS batch processing is unavoidably
complex, but the usage of function keys is simple.  There are five
distinct options:

   Option 1 (default).  Function keys in ESS[SAS] are not bound to elisp
commands.  This is in accordance with the GNU Elisp Coding Standards
(GECS) which do not allow function keys to be bound so that they are
available to the user.

   Options 2-5.  Since GECS does not allow function keys to be bound by
modes, these keys are often unused.  So, ESS[SAS] provides users with
the option of binding elisp commands to these keys.  Users who are
familiar with SAS will, most likely, want to duplicate the function key
capabilities of the SAS Display Manager.  There are four options (noted
in parentheses).

  a. SAS Display Manager has different function key definitions for
     UNIX (2, 4) and Windows (3, 5); ESS[SAS] can use either.

  b. The ESS[SAS] function key definitions can be active in all buffers
     (global: 4, 5) or limited (local: 2, 3) only to buffers with files
     that are associated with ESS[SAS] as specified in your
     `auto-mode-alist'.

   The distinction between local and global is subtle.  If you want the
ESS[SAS] definitions to work when you are in the `*shell*' buffer or
when editing files other than the file extensions that ESS[SAS]
recognizes, you will most likely want to use the global definitions.
If you want your function keys to understand SAS batch commands when
you are editing SAS files, and to behave normally when editing other
files, then you will choose the local definitions.  The option can be
chosen by the person installing ESS for a site or by an individual.

  a. For a site installation or an individual, place *ONLY ONE* of the
     following lines in your initialization file prior to a
     `require'/`load'.  ESS[SAS] function keys are available in
     ESS[SAS] if you choose either 2 or 3 and in all modes if you
     choose 4 or 5:
          ;;2; (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys t)
          ;;3; (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)
          ;;4; (setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)
          ;;5; (setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)

     The names `-unix-' and `-pc-' have nothing to do with the
     operating system that you are running.  Rather, they mimic the
     definitions that the SAS Display Manager uses by default on those
     platforms.

  b. If your site installation has configured the keys contrary to your
     liking, then you must call the appropriate function.
           (load "ess-site") ;; local-unix-keys
           (ess-sas-global-pc-keys)

   Finally, we get to what the function keys actually do.  You may
recognize some of the nicknames as SAS Display Manager commands (they
are in all capitals).

UNIX     PC       Nickname
<F2>     <F2>     `refresh'

<F3>     <F8>     `SUBMIT'
                  save the current `.sas' file (which is either the `.sas'

                  debugging situations
<F11>    <F11>    `filetype-2'
                  switch buffer to `filetype-2' (defaults to `.dat') file
                  and `refresh'
<F12>    <F12>    viewgraph
                  open a `GSASFILE' near point for viewing either in emacs
                  or with an external viewer
`C-<F1>' `C-<F1>' rtf-portrait
                  create an MS RTF portrait file from the current buffer
                  with a file extension of `.rtf'
`C-<F2>' `C-<F2>' rtf-landscape
                  create an MS RTF landscape file from the current buffer
                  with a file extension of `.rtf'
`C-<F3>' `C-<F8>' submit-region
                  write region to `ess-temp.sas' and submit

`C-<F9>' `C-<F9>' `INSIGHT'
                  open an interactive `PROC INSIGHT' session on the SAS
                  dataset near point
`C-<F10>'`C-<F10>'toggle-listing
                  toggle ESS[SAS] for `.lst' files; useful for toggling
                  read-only

   `SUBMIT', `PROGRAM', `LOG' and `OUTPUT' need no further explanation
since they mimic the SAS Display Manager commands and related function
key definitions.  However, six other keys have been provided for
convenience and are described below.

   `shell' switches you to the `*shell*' buffer where you can interact
with your operating system.  This is especially helpful if you would
like to kill a SAS batch job.  You can specify a different buffer name
to associate with a SAS batch job (besides `*shell*') with the
buffer-local variable `ess-sas-shell-buffer'.  This allows you to have
multiple buffers running SAS batch jobs on multiple local/remote
computers that may rely on different methods specified by the
buffer-local variable `ess-sas-submit-method'.

   <F2> performs the `refresh' operation on the current buffer.
`refresh' compares the buffer's last modified date/time with the file's
last modified date/time and replaces the buffer with the file if the
file is newer.  This is the same operation that is automatically
performed when `LOG', `OUTPUT', `filetype-1' or <F11> are pressed.

   `filetype-1' switches you to a file with the same file name as your
`.sas' file, but with a different extension (`.txt' by default) and
performs `refresh'.  You can over-ride the default extension; for
example in your `~/.emacs' or `~/.xemacs/init.el' file:
     (setq ess-sas-suffix-1 "csv") ; for example

   <F9> will prompt you for the name of a permanent SAS dataset near
point to be opened for viewing by `PROC FSEDIT'.  You can control the
SAS batch command-line with `ess-sas-data-view-submit-options'.  For
controlling the SAS batch commands, you have the global variables
`ess-sas-data-view-libname' and `ess-sas-data-view-fsview-command' as
well as the buffer-local variable `ess-sas-data-view-fsview-statement'.
If you have your SAS `LIBNAME' defined in `~/autoexec.sas', then the
defaults for these variables should be sufficient.

   Similarly, `C-<F9>' will prompt you for the name of a permanent SAS
dataset near point to be opened for viewing by `PROC INSIGHT'.  You can
control the SAS batch command-line with
`ess-sas-data-view-submit-options'.  For controlling the SAS batch
commands, you have the global variables `ess-sas-data-view-libname' and
`ess-sas-data-view-insight-command' as well as the buffer-local
variable `ess-sas-data-view-insight-statement'.

   <F10> toggles ESS[SAS] mode for `.log' files which is off by default
(technically, it is `SAS-log-mode', but it looks the same).  The syntax
highlighting can be helpful in certain debugging situations, but large
`.log' files may take a long time to highlight.

   <F11> is the same as `filetype-1' except it is `.dat' by default.

   <F12> will prompt you for the name of a `GSASFILE' near the point in
`.log' to be opened for viewing either with emacs or with an external
viewer.  Depending on your version of emacs and the operating system
you are using, emacs may support `.gif' and `.jpg' files internally.
You may need to change the following variables for your own situation.
`ess-sas-graph-view-suffix-regexp' is a regular expression of supported
file types defined via file name extensions.
`ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default' is the default external viewer for
your platform.  `ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist' is an alist of
exceptions to the default; i.e. file types and their associated viewers
which will be used rather than the default viewer.
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-suffix-regexp (concat "[.]\\([eE]?[pP][sS]\\|"
     "[pP][dD][fF]\\|[gG][iI][fF]\\|[jJ][pP][eE]?[gG]\\|"
     "[tT][iI][fF][fF]?\\)")) ;; default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default "kodakimg") ;; Windows default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default "sdtimage") ;; Solaris default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist
       '(("[eE]?[pP][sS]" . "gv") ("[pP][dD][fF]" . "gv")) ;; default w/ gv

   `C-<F2>' produces US landscape by default, however, it can produce A4
landscape (first line for "global" key mapping, second for "local"):
     (global-set-key [(control f2)] 'ess-sas-rtf-a4-landscape)
     (define-key sas-mode-local-map [(control f2)] 'ess-sas-rtf-a4-landscape)

10.6 iESS(SAS)-Interactive SAS processes
========================================

Inferior ESS (iESS) is the method for interfacing with interactive
statistical processes (programs).  iESS[SAS] is what is needed for
interactive SAS programming.  iESS[SAS] works best with the SAS
command-line option settings `"-stdio -linesize 80 -noovp
-nosyntaxcheck"' (the default of `inferior-SAS-args').

     `-stdio'
                 required to make the redirection of stdio work
     `-linesize 80'
                 keeps output lines from folding on standard terminals
     `-noovp'
                 prevents error messages from printing 3 times
     `-nosyntaxcheck'
                 permits recovery after syntax errors

   To start up iESS[SAS] mode, use:
        M-x SAS

   The `*SAS:1.log*' buffer in `ESStr' mode corresponds to the file
`FOO.log' in SAS batch usage and to the `SAS: LOG' window in the SAS
Display Manager.  All commands submitted to SAS, informative messages,
warnings, and errors appear here.

   The `*SAS:1.lst*' buffer in `ESSlst' mode corresponds to the file
`FOO.lst' in SAS batch usage and to the `SAS: OUTPUT' window in the SAS
Display Manager.  All printed output appears in this window.

   The `*SAS:1*' buffer exists solely as a communications buffer.  The
user should never use this buffer directly.  Files are edited in the
`FOO.sas' buffer.  The `C-c C-r' key in ESS[SAS] is the functional
equivalent of bringing a file into the `SAS: PROGRAM EDITOR' window
followed by `SUBMIT'.

   For example, open the file you want to work with.
     C-x C-f foo.sas
   `FOO.sas' will be in ESS[SAS] mode.  Edit as appropriate, and then
start up SAS with the cursor in the `FOO.sas' buffer.
     M-x SAS
   Four buffers will appear on screen:
Buffer         Mode              Description
`FOO.sas'      `ESS[SAS]'        your source file
`*SAS:1*'      `iESS[SAS:1]'     iESS communication buffer
`*SAS:1.log*'  `Shell ESStr []'  SAS log information
`*SAS:1.lst*'  `Shell ESSlst     SAS listing information
               []'               
   If you would prefer each of the four buffers to appear in its own
individual frame, you can arrange for that.  Place the cursor in the
buffer displaying `FOO.sas'.  Enter the sequence `C-c C-w'. The cursor
will normally be in buffer `FOO.sas'.  If not, put it there and
`C-x b FOO.sas'.

   Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to SAS (regions are
most useful:  a highlighted region will normally begin with the
keywords `DATA' or `PROC' and end with `RUN;'), `C-c C-r'.

   Information appears in the log buffer, analysis results in the
listing buffer.  In case of errors, make the corrections in the
`FOO.sas' buffer and resubmit with another `C-c C-r'.

   At the end of the session you may save the log and listing buffers
with the usual `C-x C-s' commands.  You will be prompted for a file
name.  Typically, the names `FOO.log' and `FOO.lst' will be used.  You
will almost certainly want to edit the saved files before including
them in a report.  The files are read-only by default.  You can make
them writable by the emacs command `C-x C-q'.

   At the end of the session, the input file `FOO.sas' will typically
have been revised.  You can save it.  It can be used later as the
beginning of another iESS[SAS] session.  It can also be used as a batch
input file to SAS.

   The `*SAS:1*' buffer is strictly for ESS use.  The user should never
need to read it or write to it.  Refer to the `.lst' and `.log' buffers
for monitoring output!

10.7 iESS(SAS)-Common problems
==============================

  1. iESS[SAS] does not work on Windows.  In order to run SAS inside an
     emacs buffer, it is necessary to start SAS with the `-stdio'
     option.  SAS does not support the `-stdio' option on Windows.

  2. If `M-x SAS' gives errors upon startup, check the following:
        * you are running Windows:  see 1.

        * `ess-sas-sh-command' (from the ESS `etc' directory) needs to
          be executable; too check, type `M-x dired'; if not, fix it as
          follows, type `M-:', then at the minibuffer prompt `Eval:',
          type `(set-file-modes "ess-sas-sh-command" 493)'.

        * `sas' isn't in your executable path; to verify, type `M-:'
          and at the minibuffer prompt `Eval:', type `(executable-find
          "sas")'

  3. `M-x SAS' starts SAS Display Manager.  Probably, the command `sas'
     on your system calls a shell script.  In that case you will need
     to locate the real  `sas' executable and link to it.  You can
     execute the UNIX command:
          find / -name sas -print
     Now place a soft link to the real `sas' executable in your `~/bin'
     directory, with for example
          cd ~/bin
          ln -s /usr/local/sas9/sas sas
     Check your `PATH' environment variable to confirm that `~/bin'
appears before the directory in which the `sas' shell script appears.

10.8 ESS(SAS)-Graphics
======================

Output from a SAS/GRAPH `PROC' can be displayed in a SAS/GRAPH window
for SAS batch on Windows or for both SAS batch and interactive with
XWindows on UNIX.  If you need to create graphics files and view them
with <F12>, then include the following (either in `FOO.sas' or in
`~/autoexec.sas'):
     filename gsasfile 'graphics.ps';
     goptions device=ps gsfname=gsasfile gsfmode=append;
   `PROC PLOT' graphs can be viewed in the listing buffer.  You may
wish to control the vertical spacing to allow the entire plot to be
visible on screen, for example:
     proc plot;
         plot a*b / vpos=25;
     run;

   * ESS[SAS] mode for editing SAS language files works very well.
     *Note ESS(SAS)--Editing files::.

   * There are two execution options for SAS on Windows.  You can use

   ESS[BUGS] was originally designed for use with BUGS software.
Later, it evolved to support JAGS as a dialect of the BUGS language via
ESS[JAGS], however, ESS[JAGS] is documented in the section Help for
JAGS.  ESS[BUGS] provides 5 features.  First, BUGS syntax is described
to allow for proper fontification of statements, distributions,
functions, commands and comments in BUGS model files, command files and
log files.  Second, ESS creates templates for the command file from the
model file so that a BUGS batch process can be defined by a single
file.  Third, ESS provides a BUGS batch script that allows ESS to set
BUGS batch parameters.  Fourth, key sequences are defined to create a
command file and submit a BUGS batch process.  Lastly, interactive
submission of BUGS commands is also supported.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(BUGS)--Model files,  Next: ESS(BUGS)--Command files,  Prev: ESS for BUGS,  Up: ESS for BUGS

11.1 ESS[BUGS]-Model files
==========================

Model files with the `.bug' extension are edited in ESS[BUGS] mode if
`(require 'ess-bugs-d)' was performed or edited in ESS[JAGS] mode if
`(require 'ess-jags-d)'.  Three keys are bound for your use in
ESS[BUGS], `F2', `C-c C-c' and `='.  `F2' performs the same action as
it does in ESS[SAS], *Note ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch
processing::.  `C-c C-c' performs the function `ess-bugs-next-action'
which you will use a lot.  Pressing it in an empty buffer for a model
file will produce a template for you.  `=' inserts the set operator,
`<-'.

   ESS[BUGS] supports "replacement" variables.  These variables are
created as part of the template, i.e. with the first press of `C-c C-c'
in an empty buffer.  They are named by all capitals and start with `%':
`%N', `%DATA', `%INIT', `%MONITOR' and `%STATS'.  When you are finished
editing your model file, pressing `C-c C-c' will perform the necessary
replacements and build your command file for you.

   The `%DATA' variable appears in the line `data in "%DATA";'.  On the
second press of `C-c C-c', `%DATA' will be replaced by the model file
name except it will have the `.dat' extension.  If your data file is
named something else, then change `%DATA' in the template to the
appropriate file name and no replacement will occur.

   The `%INIT' variable appears in the line `inits in "%INIT";'.  On
the second press of `C-c C-c', `%INIT' will be replaced by the model
file name except it will have the .in extension.  If your model will be
generating it's own initial values, place a comment character, `#', at
the beginning of the line.  Or, if your init file is named something
else, then change `%INIT' in the template to the appropriate file name.

   The `%N' variable appears in the line `const N = 0;#%N'.  Although
it is commented, it is still active.  Notice that later on in the
template you have the line `for (i in 1:N)'.  The BUGS constant `N' is
the number of rows in your data file.  When you press `C-c C-c', the
data file is read and the number of lines are counted (after `%DATA' is
resolved, if necessary).  The number of lines replace the zero in the
`const N = 0;' statement.

   The `%MONITOR' variable appears on a line by itself.  Although it is
commented, it is still active.  This line is a list of variables that
you want monitored.  When you press `C-c C-c', the appropriate
statements are created in the command file to monitor the list of
variables.  If the line is blank, then the list is populated with the
variables from the `var' statement.

   The `%STATS' variable is similar to the `%MONITOR' variable.  It is
a list of variables for which summary statistics will be calculated.
When you press `C-c C-c', the appropriate statements will be generated
in your command file.

   Please note that the `%DATA' and `%INIT' variables are only replaced
on the second press of `C-c C-c', but the actions for `%N', `%MONITOR'
and `%STATS' are performed on each press of `C-c C-c' if you re-visit
the model file.

11.2 ESS[BUGS]-Command files
============================

To avoid extension name collision, `.bmd' is used for BUGS command
files and `.jmd' for JAGS command files.  When you have finished
editing your model file and press `C-c C-c', a command file is created
if one does not already exist.  However, the command file was created,
it recognizes two "replacement" variables: `%MONITOR' and `%STATS'.

   Two `%MONITOR' variables appears on lines by themselves.  Although
they are commented, they are still active.  Between them appears the
necessary statements to monitor the list of variables specified in the
model file.  The behavior of the `%STATS' variable is similar.

   When you are finished editing your command file, pressing `C-c C-c'
again will submit your command file as a batch job.  BUGS batch scripts
are provided for both Unix and DOS in the `etc' sub-directory of the
ESS distribution.  The Unix script is `backbugs' for BUGS major version
0.6 and `backbug5' for 0.5. The DOS script is `BACKBUGS.BAT' for BUGS
major version 0.6 only.  These scripts allows ESS access to BUGS batch
features that are not readily available with the batch scripts that
come with BUGS.

11.3 ESS[BUGS]-Log files
========================

To avoid extension name collision, `.bog' is used for BUGS log files.
The BUGS batch script provided with ESS creates the `.bog' file from
the `.log' file when the batch process completes.  If you need to look
at the `.log' file while the batch process is running, it will not
appear in ESS[BUGS] mode.  You may find `F2' useful to refresh the
`.log' if the batch process over-writes or appends it.

12 ESS for JAGS
***************

* Menu:

* ESS(JAGS)--Model files::
* ESS(JAGS)--Command files::
* ESS(JAGS)--Log files::

   ESS[BUGS] was originally designed for use with BUGS software.
Later, it evolved to support JAGS as a dialect of the BUGS language via
ESS[JAGS].  Since BUGS and JAGS are quite similar, ESS[BUGS] and
ESS[JAGS] are necessarily similar.  ESS[JAGS] provides 4 features.
First, JAGS syntax is described to allow for proper fontification of
statements, distributions, functions, commands and comments in JAGS
model files, command files and log files.  Second, ESS creates
templates for the command file from the model file so that a JAGS batch
process can be defined by a single file.  Third, ESS provides a JAGS
batch script that allows ESS to set JAGS batch parameters.  Fourth, key
sequences are defined to create a command file and submit a JAGS batch
process.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(JAGS)--Model files,  Next: ESS(JAGS)--Command files,  Prev: ESS for JAGS,  Up: ESS for JAGS

12.1 ESS[JAGS]-Model files
==========================

Model files with the `.bug' extension are edited in ESS[BUGS] mode if
`(require 'ess-bugs-d)' was performed or edited in ESS[JAGS] mode if
`(require 'ess-jags-d)'.  Three keys are bound for your use in
ESS[BUGS], `F2', `C-c C-c' and `='.  `F2' performs the same action as
it does in ESS[SAS], *Note ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch
processing::.  `C-c C-c' performs the function `ess-bugs-next-action'
which you will use a lot.  Pressing it in an empty buffer for a model
file will produce a template for you.  `=' inserts the set operator,
`<-'.

   ESS[JAGS] does not support "replacement" variables which were part of
ESS[BUGS].  Although, "replacement" variables are an extremely
convenient feature, creating the elisp code for their operation was
challenging.  So, a more elisp-ish approach was adopted for ESS[JAGS]:
elisp local variables.  These variables are created as part of the
template, i.e. with the first press of `C-c C-c' in an empty buffer.
For your `.bug' file, they are named `ess-jags-chains',
`ess-jags-monitor', `ess-jags-thin', `ess-jags-burnin' and
`ess-jags-update'; they appear in the `Local Variables' section.  When
you are finished editing your model file, pressing `C-c C-c' will
perform the necessary actions to build your command file for you.

   The `ess-jags-chains' variable is the number of chains that you want
to initialize and sample from; defaults to 1.  The `ess-jags-monitor'
variable is a list of variables that you want monitored: encase each
variable in double quotes.  When you press `C-c C-c', the appropriate
statements are created in the command file to monitor the list of
variables.  By default, no variables are explicitly monitored which
means JAGS will implicitly monitor all "default" variables.  The
`ess-jags-thin' variable is the thinning parameter.  By default, the
thinning parameter is set to 1, i.e. no thinning.  The
`ess-jags-burnin' variable is the number of initial samples to discard.
By default, the burnin parameter is set to 10000.  The
`ess-jags-update' variable is the number of post-burnin samples to
keep.  By default, the update parameter is set to 10000.  Both
`ess-jags-burnin' and `ess-jags-update' are multiplied by
`ess-jags-thin' since JAGS does not do it automatically.

12.2 ESS[JAGS]-Command files
============================

To avoid extension name collision, `.bmd' is used for BUGS command
files and `.jmd' for JAGS command files.  For your `.jmd' file, there
is only one variable, `ess-jags-command', in the `Local Variables'
section.  When you have finished editing your model file and press `C-c
C-c', a command file is created if one does not already exist.  When
you are finished editing your command file, pressing `C-c C-c' again
will submit your command file as a batch job.  The `ess-jags-command'
variable allows you to specify a different JAGS program to use to run
your model; defaults to "jags".

12.3 ESS[JAGS]-Log files
========================

The `.jog' extension is used for JAGS log files.  You may find `F2'
useful to refresh the `.jog' if the batch process over-writes or
appends it.

File: ess.info,  Node: Highlighting,  Next: Parens,  Prev: Miscellaneous,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.1 Syntactic highlighting of buffers
======================================

ESS provides Font-Lock (*note Using Multiple Typefaces: (emacs)Faces.)
patterns for Inferior S Mode, S Mode, and S Transcript Mode buffers.  

   Syntax highlighting within ESS buffers is controlled by the variable
`ess-font-lock-mode', which by default is true.  Input to inferior ESS
processes is also highlighted syntactically if
`inferior-ess-font-lock-input' is non-nil (the default).  If you change
the value of either of these varibles, you need to restart emacs for
your changes to take effect.

   The font-lock patterns are defined in the following variables, which
you may modify if desired:

 -- Variable: inferior-ess-R-font-lock-keywords
     Font-lock patterns for inferior *R* processes.  (There is a
     corresponding `inferior-ess-S-font-lock-keywords' for *S*
     processes.) The default value highlights prompts, inputs,
     assignments, output messages, vector and matrix labels, and
     literals such as `NA' and `TRUE'.

 -- Variable: ess-R-mode-font-lock-keywords
     Font-lock patterns for ESS R programming mode.  (There is a
     corresponding `ess-S-mode-font-lock-keywords' for S buffers.) The
     default value highlights function names, literals, assignments,
     source functions and reserved words.


File: ess.info,  Node: Parens,  Next: Graphics,  Prev: Highlighting,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.2 Parenthesis matching
=========================

Emacs and XEmacs have facilities for highlighting the parenthesis
matching the parenthesis at point.  This feature is very useful when
trying to examine which parentheses match each other.  This highlighting
also indicates when parentheses are not matching.  Depending on what
version of emacs you use, one of the following should work in your
initialisation file:

     (paren-set-mode 'paren) ;for XEmacs
     (show-paren-mode t) ;for Emacs


File: ess.info,  Node: Graphics,  Next: Imenu,  Prev: Parens,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.3 Using graphics with ESS
============================

One of the main features of the `S' package is its ability to generate
high-resolution graphics plots, and ESS provides a number of features
for dealing with such plots.

* Menu:

* printer::                     The printer() graphics driver
* X11::                         The X11() (and other X-windows based) driver
* winjava::                     Java Graphics Device


File: ess.info,  Node: printer,  Next: X11,  Prev: Graphics,  Up: Graphics

13.3.1 Using ESS with the `printer()' driver
--------------------------------------------

This is the simplest (and least desirable) method of using graphics
within ESS.  S's `printer()' device driver produces crude character
based plots which can be contained within the ESS process buffer
itself.  To start using character graphics, issue the S command
     printer(width=79)
   (the `width=79' argument prevents Emacs line-wrapping at column 80
on an 80-column terminal.  Use a different value for a terminal with a
different number of columns.) Plotting commands do not generate
graphics immediately, but are stored until the `show()' command is
issued, which displays the current figure.


File: ess.info,  Node: X11,  Next: winjava,  Prev: printer,  Up: Graphics

13.3.2 Using ESS with windowing devices
---------------------------------------

Of course, the ideal way to use graphics with ESS is to use a windowing
system.  Under X11, this requires that the DISPLAY environment variable
be appropriately set, which may not always be the case within your
Emacs process.  ESS provides a facility for setting the value of
DISPLAY before the ESS process is started if the variable
`ess-ask-about-display' is non-`nil'.


File: ess.info,  Node: winjava,  Prev: X11,  Up: Graphics

13.3.3 Java Graphics Device
---------------------------

S+6.1 and newer on Windows contains a java library that supports
graphics.  Send the commands:

     library(winjava)
     java.graph()

to start the graphics driver.  This allows you to use ESS for both
interaction and graphics within S-PLUS.  (Thanks to Tim Hesterberg for
this information.)


File: ess.info,  Node: Imenu,  Next: Toolbar,  Prev: Graphics,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.4 Imenu
==========

Imenu is an Emacs tool for providing mode-specific buffer indexes.  In
some of the ESS editing modes (currently SAS and S), support for Imenu
is provided.  For example, in S mode buffers, the menubar should display
an item called "Imenu-S".  Within this menubar you will then be offered
bookmarks to particular parts of your source file (such as the starting
point of each function definition).

   Imenu works by searching your buffer for lines that match what ESS
thinks is the beginning of a suitable entry, e.g. the beginning of a
function definition.  To examine the regular expression that ESS uses,
check the value of `imenu-generic-expression'.  This value is set by
various ESS variables such as `ess-imenu-S-generic-expression'.


File: ess.info,  Node: Toolbar,  Next: TAGS,  Prev: Imenu,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.5 Toolbar
============

The R and S editing modes have support for a toolbar.  This toolbar
provides icons to act as shortcuts for starting new S/R processes, or
for evaluating regions of your source buffers.  The toolbar should be
present if your emacs can display images.  *Note Customization::, for
ways to change the toolbar.


File: ess.info,  Node: TAGS,  Next: Rdired,  Prev: Toolbar,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.6 TAGS
=========

The Emacs tags facility can be used to navigate around your files
containing definitions of S functions.  This facility is independent of
ESS usage, but is written here since ESS users may wish to take
advantage of TAGS facility.  Read more about emacs tags in an emacs
manual.

   Etags, the program that generates the TAGS file, does not yet know
the syntax to recognise function definitions in S files.  Hence, you
will need to provide a regexp that matches your function definitions.
Here is an example call (broken over two lines; type as one line) that
should be appropriate.

     etags --language=none
     --regex='/\([^ \t]+\)[ \t]*<-[ \t]*function/\1/' *.R

   This will find entries in your source file of the form:

     some.name <- function

   with the function name starting in column 0.  Windows users may need
to change the single quotes to double quotes.

   R version 2.9.0 introduced a front-end script for finding R tags,
which calls the `rtags()' function.  By default, this script will
recursively search the directories for relevant tags in R/C/Rd files.
To use this script from the command line, try the following to get
started:

     R CMD rtags --help

   For further details, see `http://developer.r-project.org/rtags.html'


File: ess.info,  Node: Rdired,  Next: Rutils,  Prev: TAGS,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.7 Rdired
===========

Ess-rdired provides a dired-like buffer for viewing, editing and
plotting objects in your current R session.  If you are used to using
the dired (directory editor) facility in Emacs, this mode gives you
similar functionality for R objects.

   To get started, first make sure you can load ess-rdired.  Add the
following to your .emacs and then restart emacs.
     (autoload 'ess-rdired "ess-rdired"
       "View *R* objects in a dired-like buffer." t)

   Start an R session with `M-x R' and then store a few variables, such
as:

     s <- sin(seq(from=0, to=8*pi, length=100))
     x <- c(1, 4, 9)
     y <- rnorm(20)
     z <- TRUE

   Then use `M-x ess-rdired' to create a buffer listing the objects in
your current environment and display it in a new window:
                 mode length
       s      numeric    100
       x      numeric      3
       y      numeric     20
       z      logical      1

   Type `C-h m' or `?' to get a list of the keybindings for this mode.
For example, with your point on the line of a variable, `p' will plot
the object, `v' will view it, and `d' will mark the object for deletion
(`x' will actually perform the deletion).


File: ess.info,  Node: Rutils,  Next: Org,  Prev: Rdired,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.8 Rutils
===========

Ess-rutils builds up on ess-rdired, providing key bindings for
performing basic R functions in the inferior-ESS process buffer, such as
loading and managing packages, object manipulation (listing, viewing,
and deleting), and alternatives to `help.start()' and `RSiteSearch()'
that use the `browse-url' Emacs function.  The library can be loaded
using `M-x load-file', but the easiest is to include:

     (require 'ess-rutils)

   in your .emacs.  Once R is started with `M-x R', and if the value of
the customizable variable `ess-rutils-keys' is true, several key
bindings become available in iESS process buffers:

   * `C-c C-. l' (`ess-rutils-local-pkgs')
     List all packages in all available libraries.

   * `C-c C-. r' (`ess-rutils-repos-pkgs')
     List available packages from repositories listed by
     `getOptions(``repos'')' in the current R session.

   * `C-c C-. u' (`ess-rutils-update-pkgs')
     Update packages in a particular library and repository.

   * `C-c C-. a' (`ess-rutils-apropos')
     Search for a string using apropos.

   * `C-c C-. m' (`ess-rutils-rm-all')
     Remove all R objects.

   * `C-c C-. o' (`ess-rutils-objs')
     Manipulate R objects; wrapper for `ess-rdired'.

   * `C-c C-. w' (`ess-rutils-load-wkspc')
     Load a workspace file into R.

   * `C-c C-. s' (`ess-rutils-save-wkspc')
     Save a workspace file.

   * `C-c C-. d' (`ess-change-directory')
     Change the working directory for the current R session.

   * `C-c C-. H' (`ess-rutils-html-docs')
     Use `browse-url' to navigate R html documentation.


   See the submenu `Rutils' under the iESS menu for alternative access
to these functions.  The function `ess-rutils-rsitesearch' is provided
without a particular key binding.  This function is useful in any Emacs
buffer, so can be bound to a user-defined key:

     (eval-after-load "ess-rutils"
       '(global-set-key [(control c) (f6)] 'ess-rutils-rsitesearch))
   
   Functions for listing objects and packages (`ess-rutils-local-pkgs',
`ess-rutils-repos-pkgs', and `ess-rutils-objs') show results in a
separate buffer and window, in `ess-rutils-mode', providing useful key
bindings in this mode (type `?' in this buffer for a description).


File: ess.info,  Node: Org,  Next: Sweave and AUCTeX,  Prev: Rutils,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.9 Interaction with Org mode
==============================

Org-mode (`http://orgmode.org') now supports reproducible research and
literate programming in many languages (including R) - see chapter 14
of the Org manual
(`http://orgmode.org/org.html#Working-With-Source-Code').  For ESS
users, this offers a document-based work environment within which to
embed ESS usage.  R code lives in code blocks of an Org document, from
which it can be edited in ess-mode, evaluated, extracted ("tangled") to
pure code files.  The code can also be exported ("woven") with the
surrounding text to several formats including HTML and LaTeX.  Results
of evaluation including figures can be captured in the Org document, and
data can be passed from the Org document (e.g. from a table) to the ESS
R process.  (This section contributed by Dan Davison and Eric Schulte.)


File: ess.info,  Node: Sweave and AUCTeX,  Next: Debugging R,  Prev: Org,  Up: Miscellaneous

13.10 Support for Sweave in ESS and AUCTeX
==========================================

ESS provides support for writing and processing Sweave
(`http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave'), building up on Emacs'
noweb-mode for literate programming.  When working on an Sweave
document, the following key bindings are available:

   * `M-n s' (`ess-swv-weave')
     Run Sweave on the current .Rnw file.

   * `M-n l' (`ess-swv-latex')
     Run LaTeX after Sweave'ing.

   * `M-n p' (`ess-swv-PS')
     Generate and display a postscript file after LaTeX'ing.

   * `M-n P' (`ess-swv-PDF')
     Generate and display a PDF file after LaTeX'ing.  The command used
     to generate the PDF file is the first element of
     `ess-swv-pdflatex-commands'.


   Sweave'ing with `ess-swv-weave' starts an inferior-ESS process, if
one is not available.  Other commands are available from the `Sweaving,
Tangling, ...' submenu of the Noweb menu.

   AUCTeX (`http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex') users may prefer to
set the variable `ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p' (available from the "ESS
Sweave" customization group) to t.  Alternatively, the same can be
achieved by activating the entry "AUCTeX Interface" from the `Sweaving,
Tangling, ...' submenu, which toggles this variable on or off.  When
the interface is activated, new entries for Sweave'ing and LaTeX'ing
thereafter are available from AUCTeX's "Command" menu.  Sweave'ing can,
thus, be done by `C-c C-c Sweave RET' without an inferior-ESS process.
Similarly, LaTeX'ing can be done by `C-c C-c LaTeXSweave RET'.  In both
cases, the process can be monitored with `C-c C-l'
(`TeX-recenter-output-buffer').  Open the viewer with `C-c C-v'
(`TeX-view'), as usual in AUCTeX.

13.11 Debugging R code in ESS
=============================

There are currently two extra facilities that have been developed for
debugging R code within ESS.

   * "Ess-tracebug is a package for interactive visual debugging of R
     code from ESS. It provides visual debugging, browser, recover and
     conditional breakpoints; watch window and loggers; interactive
     debug/undebug of R functions and methods at point; highlighting
     and easy error navigation and interactive traceback."
     `http://code.google.com/p/ess-tracebug/'

   * The R package edtdbg "integrates R's debugging facilities with your
     text editor, featuring code tracking, variable display, quick
     breakpoint setting, and easy toggling of function debug status."
     It provides support for both Emacs and VIM.  Package available
     from CRAN mirrors.

14.1 Bugs
=========

   * Commands like `ess-display-help-on-object' and list completion
     cannot be used while the user is entering a multi-line command.
     The only real fix in this situation is to use another ESS process.

   * The `ess-eval-' commands can leave point in the ESS process buffer
     in the wrong place when point is at the same position as the last
     process output.  This proves difficult to fix, in general, as we
     need to consider all _windows_ with `window-point' at the right
     place.

   * It's possible to clear the modification flag (say, by saving the
     buffer) with the edit buffer not having been loaded into S.

   * Backup files can sometimes be left behind, even when
     `ess-keep-dump-files' is `nil'.

   * Passing an incomplete S expression to `ess-execute' causes ESS to
     hang.

   * The function-based commands don't always work as expected on
     functions whose body is not a parenthesized or compound
     expression, and don't even recognize anonymous functions (i.e.
     functions not assigned to any variable).

   * Multi-line commands could be handled better by the command history
     mechanism.

   * Changes to the continutation prompt in R (e.g.  `options(continue
     = "    ")') are not automatically detected by ESS.  Hence, for
     now, the best thing is not to change the continuation prompt.  If
     you do change the continuation prompt, you will need to change
     accordingly the value of `inferior-ess-secondary-prompt' in
     `R-customize-alist'.

14.2 Reporting Bugs
===================

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to
<ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>

   The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   `M-x ess-submit-bug-report'

   This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem.
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET".  Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

   Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

low-volume mailing list.

   The purposes of the mailing list include

   *  helping users of ESS to get along with it.

   *  discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs.

   *  suggestions for improvements.

   *  announcements of new releases of ESS.

   *  posting small patches to ESS.

14.4 Help with emacs
====================

Emacs is a complex editor with many abilities that we do not have space
to describe here.  If you have problems with other features of emacs
(e.g. printing), there are several sources to consult, including the
emacs FAQs (try `M-x xemacs-www-faq' or `M-x view-emacs-FAQ') and
EmacsWiki (`http://www.emacswiki.org').  Please consult them before
asking on the mailing list about issues that are not specific to ESS.

Appendix A Customizing ESS
**************************

ESS can be easily customized to your taste simply by including the
appropriate lines in your `.emacs' file.  There are numerous variables
which affect the behavior of ESS in certain situations which can be
modified to your liking.  Keybindings may be set or changed to your
preferences, and for per-buffer customizations hooks are also available.

   Most of these variables can be viewed and set using the Custom
facility within Emacs.  Type `M-x customize-group RET ess RET' to see
all the ESS variables that can be customized.  Variables are grouped by
subject to make it easy to find related variables.
