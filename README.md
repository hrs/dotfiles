### hrs's dotfiles

I hope you like fiddling with your `.emacs.d` ad nauseum, 'cause I
obviously do.

#### Installation

Clone this thing wherever you like (I use `~/.dotfiles`), then adjust
the `dotfiles` variable in the `link.sh` script and run it. That'll
set up a bunch of symlinks in your home directory, e.g., `~/.bashrc ->
~/.dotfiles/bashrc`.

It won't overwrite existing files, so move those out of the way first.

This isn't *really* intended for anyone's use but my own, and it's
catered to my way of doing things (duh), so, you know, be prepared for
that.

Enjoy! =)

#### Contributing

I'm open to non-malicious contributions. Shoot me a pull request, yo.
