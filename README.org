I hope you like fiddling with your =.emacs.d= ad nauseam, 'cause I obviously do.

I'm currently running [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] on an X1 Nano, usually mirrored with a single big monitor. I use the [[https://i3wm.org/][i3 window manager]], [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/][Firefox]], and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

You're probably here for my literate [[./emacs/.config/emacs/configuration.org][Emacs config]]! Most of my time is spent in either Emacs or Firefox. I think a text editor is just a terrific environment for editing text, so I use Emacs for all kinds of things that "normal" people use specialized tools for, including:

- Task management and general writing with [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]],
- Email browsing with [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]], backed by:
  - [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/][mbsync]] for synchronization over IMAP,
  - [[https://marlam.de/msmtp/][msmtp]] for sending messages over SMTP,
  - [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][mu]] for managing a local searchable index,
  - [[https://gnupg.org/][gpg]] for encryption and signatures,
  - [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/][org-contacts]] for managing contacts and addresses, and
  - [[https://www.fastmail.com][Fastmail]] for hosting,
- RSS feed reading and management with [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] and [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]], with keybindings to send articles to [[https://www.instapaper.com/][Instapaper]] to read on my phone later,
- Git with [[https://magit.vc/][magit]], and
- File management with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] and [[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async][async]].

There's also a lot of programming-specific configuration in there. I write a lot of Ruby, but there's plenty of other, too.

I also use some non-Emacs tools! I like:

- [[https://git.pwmt.org/pwmt/zathura][zathura]] as a PDF viewer,
- [[https://feh.finalrewind.org/][feh]] as my image viewer,
- [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] for password management,
- [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]] for launching applications, and to use with a few custom scripts,
- [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]] and [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][ytp-dl]] for watching videos,
- [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]] for managing books and syncing to my Kindle, and
- a hodgepodge of [[https://www.signal.org/][Signal]], [[https://discord.com/][Discord]], [[https://telegram.org/][Telegram]], [[https://zoom.us/][Zoom]], and [[https://slack.com/][Slack]] for (quasi-)synchronous communication. They're all clunky in their own ways, but: network effects.

This whole repository isn't /really/ intended for anyone's use but my own, and of course it's catered to my way of doing things, so, you know, be prepared for that.

Enjoy! :grin:

* Installation

Clone this thing wherever you like (I use =~/.dotfiles=) and run the =install.sh= script. That will:

- Install a bunch of Debian packages,
- Set up a bunch of symlinks in your home directory (e.g., =~/.bashrc= â†’ =~/.dotfiles/shell/.bashrc=), and
- Install a handful of required Ruby gems.

It (mostly) won't overwrite existing files, so move those out of the way first.

* Wallpaper

To ensure that wallpaper is set correctly, create a =~/.wallpaper-directory= symlink to the directory where you keep your wallpapers:

#+begin_src
$ ln -s /where/your/wallpapers/live ~/.wallpaper-directory
#+end_src
