;;; writing-mode.el --- A mode to facilitate writing! Mostly graphical bits and
;;; bobs.

;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Toggle some graphical elements to make prose writing more pleasant.
;;
;; Specifically, when activated, `writing-mode' currently enables
;; `mixed-pitch-mode', `olivetti-mode', and `wc-mode', creating a
;; "distraction-free" writing environment with variable-pitch fonts and a word
;; count in the mode line. It also enables `visual-line-mode', so lines wrap
;; visually instead of using hard newlines.
;;
;; It also enables lots of Org features, including hiding emphasis markers
;; unless they're under point, using a pretty ellipsis, displaying mathematical
;; entities, and displaying images inline.
;;
;; When deactivated it restores all those modes and variables to their previous
;; states.
